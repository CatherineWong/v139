title: Learning Curves for Analysis of Deep Networks
abstract: Learning curves model a classifierâ€™s test error as a function of the number
  of training samples. Prior works show that learning curves can be used to select
  model parameters and extrapolate performance. We investigate how to use learning
  curves to evaluate design choices, such as pretraining, architecture, and data augmentation.
  We propose a method to robustly estimate learning curves, abstract their parameters
  into error and data-reliance, and evaluate the effectiveness of different parameterizations.
  Our experiments exemplify use of learning curves for analysis and yield several
  interesting observations.
