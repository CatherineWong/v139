title: Nonmyopic Multifidelity Acitve Search
abstract: Active search is a learning paradigm where we seek to identify as many members
  of a rare, valuable class as possible given a labeling budget. Previous work on
  active search has assumed access to a faithful (and expensive) oracle reporting
  experimental results. However, some settings offer access to cheaper surrogates
  such as computational simulation that may aid in the search. We propose a model
  of multifidelity active search, as well as a novel, computationally efficient policy
  for this setting that is motivated by state-of-the-art classical policies. Our policy
  is nonmyopic and budget aware, allowing for a dynamic tradeoff between exploration
  and exploitation. We evaluate the performance of our solution on real-world datasets
  and demonstrate significantly better performance than natural benchmarks.
