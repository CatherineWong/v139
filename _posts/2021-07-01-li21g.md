title: 'MURAL: Meta-Learning Uncertainty-Aware Rewards for Outcome-Driven Reinforcement
  Learning'
abstract: Exploration in reinforcement learning is, in general, a challenging problem.
  A common technique to make learning easier is providing demonstrations from a human
  supervisor, but such demonstrations can be expensive and time-consuming to acquire.
  In this work, we study a more tractable class of reinforcement learning problems
  defined simply by examples of successful outcome states, which can be much easier
  to provide while still making the exploration problem more tractable. In this problem
  setting, the reward function can be obtained automatically by training a classifier
  to categorize states as successful or not. However, as we will show, this requires
  the classifier to make uncertainty-aware predictions that are very difficult using
  standard techniques for training deep networks. To address this, we propose a novel
  mechanism for obtaining calibrated uncertainty based on an amortized technique for
  computing the normalized maximum likelihood (NML) distribution, leveraging tools
  from meta-learning to make this distribution tractable. We show that the resulting
  algorithm has a number of intriguing connections to both count-based exploration
  methods and prior algorithms for learning reward functions, while also providing
  more effective guidance towards the goal. We demonstrate that our algorithm solves
  a number of challenging navigation and robotic manipulation tasks which prove difficult
  or impossible for prior methods.
