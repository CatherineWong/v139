title: A Wasserstein Minimax Framework for Mixed Linear Regression
abstract: Multi-modal distributions are commonly used to model clustered data in statistical
  learning tasks. In this paper, we consider the Mixed Linear Regression (MLR) problem.
  We propose an optimal transport-based framework for MLR problems, Wasserstein Mixed
  Linear Regression (WMLR), which minimizes the Wasserstein distance between the learned
  and target mixture regression models. Through a model-based duality analysis, WMLR
  reduces the underlying MLR task to a nonconvex-concave minimax optimization problem,
  which can be provably solved to find a minimax stationary point by the Gradient
  Descent Ascent (GDA) algorithm. In the special case of mixtures of two linear regression
  models, we show that WMLR enjoys global convergence and generalization guarantees.
  We prove that WMLR’s sample complexity grows linearly with the dimension of data.
  Finally, we discuss the application of WMLR to the federated learning task where
  the training samples are collected by multiple agents in a network. Unlike the Expectation-Maximization
  algorithm, WMLR directly extends to the distributed, federated learning setting.
  We support our theoretical results through several numerical experiments, which
  highlight our framework’s ability to handle the federated learning setting with
  mixture models.
