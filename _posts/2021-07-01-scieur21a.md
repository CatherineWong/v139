title: Connecting Sphere Manifolds Hierarchically for Regularization
abstract: This paper considers classification problems with hierarchically organized
  classes. We force the classifier (hyperplane) of each class to belong to a sphere
  manifold, whose center is the classifier of its super-class. Then, individual sphere
  manifolds are connected based on their hierarchical relations. Our technique replaces
  the last layer of a neural network by combining a spherical fully-connected layer
  with a hierarchical layer. This regularization is shown to improve the performance
  of widely used deep neural network architectures (ResNet and DenseNet) on publicly
  available datasets (CIFAR100, CUB200, Stanford dogs, Stanford cars, and Tiny-ImageNet).
