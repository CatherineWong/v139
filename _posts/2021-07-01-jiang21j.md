title: Emphatic Algorithms for Deep Reinforcement Learning
abstract: Off-policy learning allows us to learn about possible policies of behavior
  from experience generated by a different behavior policy. Temporal difference (TD)
  learning algorithms can become unstable when combined with function approximation
  and off-policy sampling—this is known as the “deadly triad”. Emphatic temporal difference
  (ETD($\lambda$)) algorithm ensures convergence in the linear case by appropriately
  weighting the TD($\lambda$) updates. In this paper, we extend the use of emphatic
  methods to deep reinforcement learning agents. We show that naively adapting ETD($\lambda$)
  to popular deep reinforcement learning algorithms, which use forward view multi-step
  returns, results in poor performance. We then derive new emphatic algorithms for
  use in the context of such algorithms, and we demonstrate that they provide noticeable
  benefits in small problems designed to highlight the instability of TD methods.
  Finally, we observed improved performance when applying these algorithms at scale
  on classic Atari games from the Arcade Learning Environment.
