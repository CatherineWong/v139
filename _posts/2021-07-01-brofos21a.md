title: Evaluating the Implicit Midpoint Integrator for Riemannian Hamiltonian Monte
  Carlo
abstract: 'Riemannian manifold Hamiltonian Monte Carlo is traditionally carried out
  using the generalized leapfrog integrator. However, this integrator is not the only
  choice and other integrators yielding valid Markov chain transition operators may
  be considered. In this work, we examine the implicit midpoint integrator as an alternative
  to the generalized leapfrog integrator. We discuss advantages and disadvantages
  of the implicit midpoint integrator for Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, its theoretical
  properties, and an empirical assessment of the critical attributes of such an integrator
  for Hamiltonian Monte Carlo: energy conservation, volume preservation, and reversibility.
  Empirically, we find that while leapfrog iterations are faster, the implicit midpoint
  integrator has better energy conservation, leading to higher acceptance rates, as
  well as better conservation of volume and better reversibility, arguably yielding
  a more accurate sampling procedure.'
