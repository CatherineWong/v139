title: Unified Robust Semi-Supervised Variational Autoencoder
abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel noise-robust semi-supervised deep generative
  model by jointly tackling noisy labels and outliers simultaneously in a unified
  robust semi-supervised variational autoencoder (URSVAE). Typically, the uncertainty
  of of input data is characterized by placing uncertainty prior on the parameters
  of the probability density distributions in order to ensure the robustness of the
  variational encoder towards outliers. Subsequently, a noise transition model is
  integrated naturally into our model to alleviate the detrimental effects of noisy
  labels. Moreover, a robust divergence measure is employed to further enhance the
  robustness, where a novel variational lower bound is derived and optimized to infer
  the network parameters. By proving the influence function on the proposed evidence
  lower bound is bounded, the enormous potential of the proposed model in the classification
  in the presence of the compound noise is demonstrated. The experimental results
  highlight the superiority of the proposed framework by the evaluating on image classification
  tasks and comparing with the state-of-the-art approaches.
