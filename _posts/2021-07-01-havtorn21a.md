title: Hierarchical VAEs Know What They Don’t Know
abstract: Deep generative models have been demonstrated as state-of-the-art density
  estimators. Yet, recent work has found that they often assign a higher likelihood
  to data from outside the training distribution. This seemingly paradoxical behavior
  has caused concerns over the quality of the attained density estimates. In the context
  of hierarchical variational autoencoders, we provide evidence to explain this behavior
  by out-of-distribution data having in-distribution low-level features. We argue
  that this is both expected and desirable behavior. With this insight in hand, we
  develop a fast, scalable and fully unsupervised likelihood-ratio score for OOD detection
  that requires data to be in-distribution across all feature-levels. We benchmark
  the method on a vast set of data and model combinations and achieve state-of-the-art
  results on out-of-distribution detection.
