title: 'DeepReDuce: ReLU Reduction for Fast Private Inference'
abstract: 'The recent rise of privacy concerns has led researchers to devise methods
  for private neural inferenceâ€”where inferences are made directly on encrypted data,
  never seeing inputs. The primary challenge facing private inference is that computing
  on encrypted data levies an impractically-high latency penalty, stemming mostly
  from non-linear operators like ReLU. Enabling practical and private inference requires
  new optimization methods that minimize network ReLU counts while preserving accuracy.
  This paper proposes DeepReDuce: a set of optimizations for the judicious removal
  of ReLUs to reduce private inference latency. The key insight is that not all ReLUs
  contribute equally to accuracy. We leverage this insight to drop, or remove, ReLUs
  from classic networks to significantly reduce inference latency and maintain high
  accuracy. Given a network architecture, DeepReDuce outputs a Pareto frontier of
  networks that tradeoff the number of ReLUs and accuracy. Compared to the state-of-the-art
  for private inference DeepReDuce improves accuracy and reduces ReLU count by up
  to 3.5% (iso-ReLU count) and 3.5x (iso-accuracy), respectively.'
