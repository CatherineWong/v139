title: Leveraging Public Data for Practical Private Query Release
abstract: In many statistical problems, incorporating priors can significantly improve
  performance. However, the use of prior knowledge in differentially private query
  release has remained underexplored, despite such priors commonly being available
  in the form of public datasets, such as previous US Census releases. With the goal
  of releasing statistics about a private dataset, we present PMW^Pub, which—unlike
  existing baselines—leverages public data drawn from a related distribution as prior
  information. We provide a theoretical analysis and an empirical evaluation on the
  American Community Survey (ACS) and ADULT datasets, which shows that our method
  outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, PMW^Pub scales well to high-dimensional
  data domains, where running many existing methods would be computationally infeasible.
