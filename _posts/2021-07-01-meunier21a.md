title: Mixed Nash Equilibria in the Adversarial Examples Game
abstract: This paper tackles the problem of adversarial examples from a game theoretic
  point of view. We study the open question of the existence of mixed Nash equilibria
  in the zero-sum game formed by the attacker and the classifier. While previous works
  usually allow only one player to use randomized strategies, we show the necessity
  of considering randomization for both the classifier and the attacker. We demonstrate
  that this game has no duality gap, meaning that it always admits approximate Nash
  equilibria. We also provide the first optimization algorithms to learn a mixture
  of classifiers that approximately realizes the value of this game, \emph{i.e.} procedures
  to build an optimally robust randomized classifier.
