title: Confidence Scores Make Instance-dependent Label-noise Learning Possible
abstract: In learning with noisy labels, for every instance, its label can randomly
  walk to other classes following a transition distribution which is named a noise
  model. Well-studied noise models are all instance-independent, namely, the transition
  depends only on the original label but not the instance itself, and thus they are
  less practical in the wild. Fortunately, methods based on instance-dependent noise
  have been studied, but most of them have to rely on strong assumptions on the noise
  models. To alleviate this issue, we introduce confidence-scored instance-dependent
  noise (CSIDN), where each instance-label pair is equipped with a confidence score.
  We find that with the help of confidence scores, the transition distribution of
  each instance can be approximately estimated. Similarly to the powerful forward
  correction for instance-independent noise, we propose a novel instance-level forward
  correction for CSIDN. We demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of our method
  through multiple experiments on datasets with synthetic label noise and real-world
  unknown noise.
