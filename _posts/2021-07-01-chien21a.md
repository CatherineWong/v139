title: 'Private Alternating Least Squares: Practical Private Matrix Completion with
  Tighter Rates'
abstract: 'We study the problem of differentially private (DP) matrix completion under
  user-level privacy. We design a joint differentially private variant of the popular
  Alternating-Least-Squares (ALS) method that achieves: i) (nearly) optimal sample
  complexity for matrix completion (in terms of number of items, users), and ii) the
  best known privacy/utility trade-off both theoretically, as well as on benchmark
  data sets. In particular, we provide the first global convergence analysis of ALS
  with noise introduced to ensure DP, and show that, in comparison to the best known
  alternative (the Private Frank-Wolfe algorithm by Jain et al. (2018)), our error
  bounds scale significantly better with respect to the number of items and users,
  which is critical in practical problems. Extensive validation on standard benchmarks
  demonstrate that the algorithm, in combination with carefully designed sampling
  procedures, is significantly more accurate than existing techniques, thus promising
  to be the first practical DP embedding model.'
