title: Towards Domain-Agnostic Contrastive Learning
abstract: Despite recent successes, most contrastive self-supervised learning methods
  are domain-specific, relying heavily on data augmentation techniques that require
  knowledge about a particular domain, such as image cropping and rotation. To overcome
  such limitation, we propose a domain-agnostic approach to contrastive learning,
  named DACL, that is applicable to problems where domain-specific data augmentations
  are not readily available. Key to our approach is the use of Mixup noise to create
  similar and dissimilar examples by mixing data samples differently either at the
  input or hidden-state levels. We theoretically analyze our method and show advantages
  over the Gaussian-noise based contrastive learning approach. To demonstrate the
  effectiveness of DACL, we conduct experiments across various domains such as tabular
  data, images, and graphs. Our results show that DACL not only outperforms other
  domain-agnostic noising methods, such as Gaussian-noise, but also combines well
  with domain-specific methods, such as SimCLR, to improve self-supervised visual
  representation learning.
