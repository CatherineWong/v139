title: Decentralized Single-Timescale Actor-Critic on Zero-Sum Two-Player Stochastic
  Games
abstract: We study the global convergence and global optimality of the actor-critic
  algorithm applied for the zero-sum two-player stochastic games in a decentralized
  manner. We focus on the single-timescale setting where the critic is updated by
  applying the Bellman operator only once and the actor is updated by policy gradient
  with the information from the critic. Our algorithm is in a decentralized manner,
  as we assume that each player has no access to the actions of the other one, which,
  in a way, protects the privacy of both players. Moreover, we consider linear function
  approximations for both actor and critic, and we prove that the sequence of joint
  policy generated by our decentralized linear algorithm converges to the minimax
  equilibrium at a sublinear rate \(\cO(\sqrt{K})\), where \(K\){is} the number of
  iterations. To the best of our knowledge, we establish the global optimality and
  convergence of decentralized actor-critic algorithm on zero-sum two-player stochastic
  games with linear function approximations for the first time.
