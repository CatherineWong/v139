title: Knowledge Enhanced Machine Learning Pipeline against Diverse Adversarial Attacks
abstract: 'Despite the great successes achieved by deep neural networks (DNNs), recent
  studies show that they are vulnerable against adversarial examples, which aim to
  mislead DNNs by adding small adversarial perturbations. Several defenses have been
  proposed against such attacks, while many of them have been adaptively attacked.
  In this work, we aim to enhance the ML robustness from a different perspective by
  leveraging domain knowledge: We propose a Knowledge Enhanced Machine Learning Pipeline
  (KEMLP) to integrate domain knowledge (i.e., logic relationships among different
  predictions) into a probabilistic graphical model via first-order logic rules. In
  particular, we develop KEMLP by integrating a diverse set of weak auxiliary models
  based on their logical relationships to the main DNN model that performs the target
  task. Theoretically, we provide convergence results and prove that, under mild conditions,
  the prediction of KEMLP is more robust than that of the main DNN model. Empirically,
  we take road sign recognition as an example and leverage the relationships between
  road signs and their shapes and contents as domain knowledge. We show that compared
  with adversarial training and other baselines, KEMLP achieves higher robustness
  against physical attacks, $\mathcal{L}_p$ bounded attacks, unforeseen attacks, and
  natural corruptions under both whitebox and blackbox settings, while still maintaining
  high clean accuracy.'
