title: Quantifying and Reducing Bias in Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Structured
  Anomalies
abstract: 'Anomaly estimation, or the problem of finding a subset of a dataset that
  differs from the rest of the dataset, is a classic problem in machine learning and
  data mining. In both theoretical work and in applications, the anomaly is assumed
  to have a specific structure defined by membership in an anomaly family. For example,
  in temporal data the anomaly family may be time intervals, while in network data
  the anomaly family may be connected subgraphs. The most prominent approach for anomaly
  estimation is to compute the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) of the anomaly;
  however, it was recently observed that for normally distributed data, the MLE is
  a biased estimator for some anomaly families. In this work, we demonstrate that
  in the normal means setting, the bias of the MLE depends on the size of the anomaly
  family. We prove that if the number of sets in the anomaly family that contain the
  anomaly is sub-exponential, then the MLE is asymptotically unbiased. We also provide
  empirical evidence that the converse is true: if the number of such sets is exponential,
  then the MLE is asymptotically biased. Our analysis unifies a number of earlier
  results on the bias of the MLE for specific anomaly families. Next, we derive a
  new anomaly estimator using a mixture model, and we prove that our anomaly estimator
  is asymptotically unbiased regardless of the size of the anomaly family. We illustrate
  the advantages of our estimator versus the MLE on disease outbreak data and highway
  traffic data.'
