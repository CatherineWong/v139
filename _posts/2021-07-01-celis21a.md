title: 'Fair Classification with Noisy Protected Attributes: A Framework with Provable
  Guarantees'
abstract: We present an optimization framework for learning a fair classifier in the
  presence of noisy perturbations in the protected attributes. Compared to prior work,
  our framework can be employed with a very general class of linear and linear-fractional
  fairness constraints, can handle multiple, non-binary protected attributes, and
  outputs a classifier that comes with provable guarantees on both accuracy and fairness.
  Empirically, we show that our framework can be used to attain either statistical
  rate or false positive rate fairness guarantees with a minimal loss in accuracy,
  even when the noise is large, in two real-world datasets.
