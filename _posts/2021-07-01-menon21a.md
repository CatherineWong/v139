title: A statistical perspective on distillation
abstract: Knowledge distillation is a technique for improving a “student” model by
  replacing its one-hot training labels with a label distribution obtained from a
  “teacher” model. Despite its broad success, several basic questions — e.g., Why
  does distillation help? Why do more accurate teachers not necessarily distill better?
  — have received limited formal study. In this paper, we present a statistical perspective
  on distillation which provides an answer to these questions. Our core observation
  is that a “Bayes teacher” providing the true class-probabilities can lower the variance
  of the student objective, and thus improve performance. We then establish a bias-variance
  tradeoff that quantifies the value of teachers that approximate the Bayes class-probabilities.
  This provides a formal criterion as to what constitutes a “good” teacher, namely,
  the quality of its probability estimates. Finally, we illustrate how our statistical
  perspective facilitates novel applications of distillation to bipartite ranking
  and multiclass retrieval.
