title: Provably End-to-end Label-noise Learning without Anchor Points
abstract: 'In label-noise learning, the transition matrix plays a key role in building
  statistically consistent classifiers. Existing consistent estimators for the transition
  matrix have been developed by exploiting anchor points. However, the anchor-point
  assumption is not always satisfied in real scenarios. In this paper, we propose
  an end-to-end framework for solving label-noise learning without anchor points,
  in which we simultaneously optimize two objectives: the cross entropy loss between
  the noisy label and the predicted probability by the neural network, and the volume
  of the simplex formed by the columns of the transition matrix. Our proposed framework
  can identify the transition matrix if the clean class-posterior probabilities are
  sufficiently scattered. This is by far the mildest assumption under which the transition
  matrix is provably identifiable and the learned classifier is statistically consistent.
  Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness
  of the proposed method.'
