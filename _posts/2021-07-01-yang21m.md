title: Delving into Deep Imbalanced Regression
abstract: 'Real-world data often exhibit imbalanced distributions, where certain target
  values have significantly fewer observations. Existing techniques for dealing with
  imbalanced data focus on targets with categorical indices, i.e., different classes.
  However, many tasks involve continuous targets, where hard boundaries between classes
  do not exist. We define Deep Imbalanced Regression (DIR) as learning from such imbalanced
  data with continuous targets, dealing with potential missing data for certain target
  values, and generalizing to the entire target range. Motivated by the intrinsic
  difference between categorical and continuous label space, we propose distribution
  smoothing for both labels and features, which explicitly acknowledges the effects
  of nearby targets, and calibrates both label and learned feature distributions.
  We curate and benchmark large-scale DIR datasets from common real-world tasks in
  computer vision, natural language processing, and healthcare domains. Extensive
  experiments verify the superior performance of our strategies. Our work fills the
  gap in benchmarks and techniques for practical imbalanced regression problems. Code
  and data are available at: https://github.com/YyzHarry/imbalanced-regression.'
