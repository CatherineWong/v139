title: Improving Lossless Compression Rates via Monte Carlo Bits-Back Coding
abstract: Latent variable models have been successfully applied in lossless compression
  with the bits-back coding algorithm. However, bits-back suffers from an increase
  in the bitrate equal to the KL divergence between the approximate posterior and
  the true posterior. In this paper, we show how to remove this gap asymptotically
  by deriving bits-back coding algorithms from tighter variational bounds. The key
  idea is to exploit extended space representations of Monte Carlo estimators of the
  marginal likelihood. Naively applied, our schemes would require more initial bits
  than the standard bits-back coder, but we show how to drastically reduce this additional
  cost with couplings in the latent space. When parallel architectures can be exploited,
  our coders can achieve better rates than bits-back with little additional cost.
  We demonstrate improved lossless compression rates in a variety of settings, especially
  in out-of-distribution or sequential data compression.
