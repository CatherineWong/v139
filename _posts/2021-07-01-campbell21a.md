title: A Gradient Based Strategy for Hamiltonian Monte Carlo Hyperparameter Optimization
abstract: Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is one of the most successful sampling methods
  in machine learning. However, its performance is significantly affected by the choice
  of hyperparameter values. Existing approaches for optimizing the HMC hyperparameters
  either optimize a proxy for mixing speed or consider the HMC chain as an implicit
  variational distribution and optimize a tractable lower bound that can be very loose
  in practice. Instead, we propose to optimize an objective that quantifies directly
  the speed of convergence to the target distribution. Our objective can be easily
  optimized using stochastic gradient descent. We evaluate our proposed method and
  compare to baselines on a variety of problems including sampling from synthetic
  2D distributions, reconstructing sparse signals, learning deep latent variable models
  and sampling molecular configurations from the Boltzmann distribution of a 22 atom
  molecule. We find that our method is competitive with or improves upon alternative
  baselines in all these experiments.
