title: Shortest-Path Constrained Reinforcement Learning for Sparse Reward Tasks
abstract: 'We propose the k-Shortest-Path (k-SP) constraint: a novel constraint on
  the agentâ€™s trajectory that improves the sample efficiency in sparse-reward MDPs.
  We show that any optimal policy necessarily satisfies the k-SP constraint. Notably,
  the k-SP constraint prevents the policy from exploring state-action pairs along
  the non-k-SP trajectories (e.g., going back and forth). However, in practice, excluding
  state-action pairs may hinder the convergence of RL algorithms. To overcome this,
  we propose a novel cost function that penalizes the policy violating SP constraint,
  instead of completely excluding it. Our numerical experiment in a tabular RL setting
  demonstrates that the SP-constraint can significantly reduce the trajectory space
  of policy. As a result, our constraint enables more sample efficient learning by
  suppressing redundant exploration and exploitation. Our experiments on MiniGrid,
  DeepMind Lab, Atari, and Fetch show that the proposed method significantly improves
  proximal policy optimization (PPO) and outperforms existing novelty-seeking exploration
  methods including count-based exploration even in continuous control tasks, indicating
  that it improves the sample efficiency by preventing the agent from taking redundant
  actions.'
