title: Probabilistic Programs with Stochastic Conditioning
abstract: We tackle the problem of conditioning probabilistic programs on distributions
  of observable variables. Probabilistic programs are usually conditioned on samples
  from the joint data distribution, which we refer to as deterministic conditioning.
  However, in many real-life scenarios, the observations are given as marginal distributions,
  summary statistics, or samplers. Conventional probabilistic programming systems
  lack adequate means for modeling and inference in such scenarios. We propose a generalization
  of deterministic conditioning to stochastic conditioning, that is, conditioning
  on the marginal distribution of a variable taking a particular form. To this end,
  we first define the formal notion of stochastic conditioning and discuss its key
  properties. We then show how to perform inference in the presence of stochastic
  conditioning. We demonstrate potential usage of stochastic conditioning on several
  case studies which involve various kinds of stochastic conditioning and are difficult
  to solve otherwise. Although we present stochastic conditioning in the context of
  probabilistic programming, our formalization is general and applicable to other
  settings.
