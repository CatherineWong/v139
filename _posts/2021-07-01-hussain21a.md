title: Neural Pharmacodynamic State Space Modeling
abstract: Modeling the time-series of high-dimensional, longitudinal data is important
  for predicting patient disease progression. However, existing neural network based
  approaches that learn representations of patient state, while very flexible, are
  susceptible to overfitting. We propose a deep generative model that makes use of
  a novel attention-based neural architecture inspired by the physics of how treatments
  affect disease state. The result is a scalable and accurate model of high-dimensional
  patient biomarkers as they vary over time. Our proposed model yields significant
  improvements in generalization and, on real-world clinical data, provides interpretable
  insights into the dynamics of cancer progression.
