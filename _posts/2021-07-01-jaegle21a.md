title: 'Perceiver: General Perception with Iterative Attention'
abstract: 'Biological systems understand the world by simultaneously processing high-dimensional
  inputs from modalities as diverse as vision, audition, touch, proprioception, etc.
  The perception models used in deep learning on the other hand are designed for individual
  modalities, often relying on domain-specific assumptions such as the local grid
  structures exploited by virtually all existing vision models. These priors introduce
  helpful inductive biases, but also lock models to individual modalities. In this
  paper we introduce the Perceiver {â€“} a model that builds upon Transformers and hence
  makes few architectural assumptions about the relationship between its inputs, but
  that also scales to hundreds of thousands of inputs, like ConvNets. The model leverages
  an asymmetric attention mechanism to iteratively distill inputs into a tight latent
  bottleneck, allowing it to scale to handle very large inputs. We show that this
  architecture is competitive with or outperforms strong, specialized models on classification
  tasks across various modalities: images, point clouds, audio, video and video+audio.
  The Perceiver obtains performance comparable to ResNet-50 and ViT on ImageNet without
  2D convolutions by directly attending to 50,000 pixels. It is also competitive in
  all modalities in AudioSet.'
