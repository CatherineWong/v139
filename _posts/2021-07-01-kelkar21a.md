title: Prior Image-Constrained Reconstruction using Style-Based Generative Models
abstract: Obtaining a useful estimate of an object from highly incomplete imaging
  measurements remains a holy grail of imaging science. Deep learning methods have
  shown promise in learning object priors or constraints to improve the conditioning
  of an ill-posed imaging inverse problem. In this study, a framework for estimating
  an object of interest that is semantically related to a known prior image, is proposed.
  An optimization problem is formulated in the disentangled latent space of a style-based
  generative model, and semantically meaningful constraints are imposed using the
  disentangled latent representation of the prior image. Stable recovery from incomplete
  measurements with the help of a prior image is theoretically analyzed. Numerical
  experiments demonstrating the superior performance of our approach as compared to
  related methods are presented.
