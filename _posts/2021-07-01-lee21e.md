title: 'Continual Learning in the Teacher-Student Setup: Impact of Task Similarity'
abstract: Continual learning{—}the ability to learn many tasks in sequence{—}is critical
  for artificial learning systems. Yet standard training methods for deep networks
  often suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where learning new tasks erases knowledge
  of the earlier tasks. While catastrophic forgetting labels the problem, the theoretical
  reasons for interference between tasks remain unclear. Here, we attempt to narrow
  this gap between theory and practice by studying continual learning in the teacher-student
  setup. We extend previous analytical work on two-layer networks in the teacher-student
  setup to multiple teachers. Using each teacher to represent a different task, we
  investigate how the relationship between teachers affects the amount of forgetting
  and transfer exhibited by the student when the task switches. In line with recent
  work, we find that when tasks depend on similar features, intermediate task similarity
  leads to greatest forgetting. However, feature similarity is only one way in which
  tasks may be related. The teacher-student approach allows us to disentangle task
  similarity at the level of \emph{readouts} (hidden-to-output weights) as well as
  \emph{features} (input-to-hidden weights). We find a complex interplay between both
  types of similarity, initial transfer/forgetting rates, maximum transfer/forgetting,
  and the long-time (post-switch) amount of transfer/forgetting. Together, these results
  help illuminate the diverse factors contributing to catastrophic forgetting.
