title: Variational (Gradient) Estimate of the Score Function in Energy-based Latent
  Variable Models
abstract: This paper presents new estimates of the score function and its gradient
  with respect to the model parameters in a general energy-based latent variable model
  (EBLVM). The score function and its gradient can be expressed as combinations of
  expectation and covariance terms over the (generally intractable) posterior of the
  latent variables. New estimates are obtained by introducing a variational posterior
  to approximate the true posterior in these terms. The variational posterior is trained
  to minimize a certain divergence (e.g., the KL divergence) between itself and the
  true posterior. Theoretically, the divergence characterizes upper bounds of the
  bias of the estimates. In principle, our estimates can be applied to a wide range
  of objectives, including kernelized Stein discrepancy (KSD), score matching (SM)-based
  methods and exact Fisher divergence with a minimal model assumption. In particular,
  these estimates applied to SM-based methods outperform existing methods in learning
  EBLVMs on several image datasets.
