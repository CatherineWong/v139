title: Decoupling Exploration and Exploitation for Meta-Reinforcement Learning without
  Sacrifices
abstract: 'The goal of meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) is to build agents that
  can quickly learn new tasks by leveraging prior experience on related tasks. Learning
  a new task often requires both exploring to gather task-relevant information and
  exploiting this information to solve the task. In principle, optimal exploration
  and exploitation can be learned end-to-end by simply maximizing task performance.
  However, such meta-RL approaches struggle with local optima due to a chicken-and-egg
  problem: learning to explore requires good exploitation to gauge the explorationâ€™s
  utility, but learning to exploit requires information gathered via exploration.
  Optimizing separate objectives for exploration and exploitation can avoid this problem,
  but prior meta-RL exploration objectives yield suboptimal policies that gather information
  irrelevant to the task. We alleviate both concerns by constructing an exploitation
  objective that automatically identifies task-relevant information and an exploration
  objective to recover only this information. This avoids local optima in end-to-end
  training, without sacrificing optimal exploration. Empirically, DREAM substantially
  outperforms existing approaches on complex meta-RL problems, such as sparse-reward
  3D visual navigation. Videos of DREAM: https://ezliu.github.io/dream/'
