title: 'PAGE: A Simple and Optimal Probabilistic Gradient Estimator for Nonconvex
  Optimization'
abstract: 'In this paper, we propose a novel stochastic gradient estimator—ProbAbilistic
  Gradient Estimator (PAGE)—for nonconvex optimization. PAGE is easy to implement
  as it is designed via a small adjustment to vanilla SGD: in each iteration, PAGE
  uses the vanilla minibatch SGD update with probability $p_t$ or reuses the previous
  gradient with a small adjustment, at a much lower computational cost, with probability
  $1-p_t$. We give a simple formula for the optimal choice of $p_t$. Moreover, we
  prove the first tight lower bound $\Omega(n+\frac{\sqrt{n}}{\epsilon^2})$ for nonconvex
  finite-sum problems, which also leads to a tight lower bound $\Omega(b+\frac{\sqrt{b}}{\epsilon^2})$
  for nonconvex online problems, where $b:= \min\{\frac{\sigma^2}{\epsilon^2}, n\}$.
  Then, we show that PAGE obtains the optimal convergence results $O(n+\frac{\sqrt{n}}{\epsilon^2})$
  (finite-sum) and $O(b+\frac{\sqrt{b}}{\epsilon^2})$ (online) matching our lower
  bounds for both nonconvex finite-sum and online problems. Besides, we also show
  that for nonconvex functions satisfying the Polyak-Ł{ojasiewicz} (PL) condition,
  PAGE can automatically switch to a faster linear convergence rate $O(\cdot\log \frac{1}{\epsilon})$.
  Finally, we conduct several deep learning experiments (e.g., LeNet, VGG, ResNet)
  on real datasets in PyTorch showing that PAGE not only converges much faster than
  SGD in training but also achieves the higher test accuracy, validating the optimal
  theoretical results and confirming the practical superiority of PAGE.'
