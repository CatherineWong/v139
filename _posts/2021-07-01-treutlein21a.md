title: A New Formalism, Method and Open Issues for Zero-Shot Coordination
abstract: In many coordination problems, independently reasoning humans are able to
  discover mutually compatible policies. In contrast, independently trained self-play
  policies are often mutually incompatible. Zero-shot coordination (ZSC) has recently
  been proposed as a new frontier in multi-agent reinforcement learning to address
  this fundamental issue. Prior work approaches the ZSC problem by assuming players
  can agree on a shared learning algorithm but not on labels for actions and observations,
  and proposes other-play as an optimal solution. However, until now, this “label-free”
  problem has only been informally defined. We formalize this setting as the label-free
  coordination (LFC) problem by defining the label-free coordination game. We show
  that other-play is not an optimal solution to the LFC problem as it fails to consistently
  break ties between incompatible maximizers of the other-play objective. We introduce
  an extension of the algorithm, other-play with tie-breaking, and prove that it is
  optimal in the LFC problem and an equilibrium in the LFC game. Since arbitrary tie-breaking
  is precisely what the ZSC setting aims to prevent, we conclude that the LFC problem
  does not reflect the aims of ZSC. To address this, we introduce an alternative informal
  operationalization of ZSC as a starting point for future work.
