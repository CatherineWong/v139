title: A New Representation of Successor Features for Transfer across Dissimilar Environments
abstract: Transfer in reinforcement learning is usually achieved through generalisation
  across tasks. Whilst many studies have investigated transferring knowledge when
  the reward function changes, they have assumed that the dynamics of the environments
  remain consistent. Many real-world RL problems require transfer among environments
  with different dynamics. To address this problem, we propose an approach based on
  successor features in which we model successor feature functions with Gaussian Processes
  permitting the source successor features to be treated as noisy measurements of
  the target successor feature function. Our theoretical analysis proves the convergence
  of this approach as well as the bounded error on modelling successor feature functions
  with Gaussian Processes in environments with both different dynamics and rewards.
  We demonstrate our method on benchmark datasets and show that it outperforms current
  baselines.
