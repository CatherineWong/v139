title: 'SG-PALM: a Fast Physically Interpretable Tensor Graphical Model'
abstract: 'We propose a new graphical model inference procedure, called SG-PALM, for
  learning conditional dependency structure of high-dimensional tensor-variate data.
  Unlike most other tensor graphical models the proposed model is interpretable and
  computationally scalable to high dimension. Physical interpretability follows from
  the Sylvester generative (SG) model on which SG-PALM is based: the model is exact
  for any observation process that is a solution of a partial differential equation
  of Poisson type. Scalability follows from the fast proximal alternating linearized
  minimization (PALM) procedure that SG-PALM uses during training. We establish that
  SG-PALM converges linearly (i.e., geometric convergence rate) to a global optimum
  of its objective function. We demonstrate scalability and accuracy of SG-PALM for
  an important but challenging climate prediction problem: spatio-temporal forecasting
  of solar flares from multimodal imaging data.'
