title: Generating images with sparse representations
abstract: The high dimensionality of images presents architecture and sampling-efficiency
  challenges for likelihood-based generative models. Previous approaches such as VQ-VAE
  use deep autoencoders to obtain compact representations, which are more practical
  as inputs for likelihood-based models. We present an alternative approach, inspired
  by common image compression methods like JPEG, and convert images to quantized discrete
  cosine transform (DCT) blocks, which are represented sparsely as a sequence of DCT
  channel, spatial location, and DCT coefficient triples. We propose a Transformer-based
  autoregressive architecture, which is trained to sequentially predict the conditional
  distribution of the next element in such sequences, and which scales effectively
  to high resolution images. On a range of image datasets, we demonstrate that our
  approach can generate high quality, diverse images, with sample metric scores competitive
  with state of the art methods. We additionally show that simple modifications to
  our method yield effective image colorization and super-resolution models.
