title: Projection techniques to update the truncated SVD of evolving matrices with
  applications
abstract: This submission considers the problem of updating the rank-$k$ truncated
  Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of matrices subject to the addition of new rows
  and/or columns over time. Such matrix problems represent an important computational
  kernel in applications such as Latent Semantic Indexing and Recommender Systems.
  Nonetheless, the proposed framework is purely algebraic and targets general updating
  problems. The algorithm presented in this paper undertakes a projection viewpoint
  and focuses on building a pair of subspaces which approximate the linear span of
  the sought singular vectors of the updated matrix. We discuss and analyze two different
  choices to form the projection subspaces. Results on matrices from real applications
  suggest that the proposed algorithm can lead to higher accuracy, especially for
  the singular triplets associated with the largest modulus singular values. Several
  practical details and key differences with other approaches are also discussed.
