title: 'Learning from Biased Data: A Semi-Parametric Approach'
abstract: We consider risk minimization problems where the (source) distribution $P_S$
  of the training observations $Z_1, \ldots, Z_n$ differs from the (target) distribution
  $P_T$ involved in the risk that one seeks to minimize. Under the natural assumption
  that $P_S$ dominates $P_T$, \textit{i.e.} $P_T< \! \!<P_S$, we develop a semi-parametric
  framework in the situation where we \textit{do not} observe any sample from $P_T$,
  but rather have access to some auxiliary information at the target population scale.
  More precisely, assuming that the Radon-Nikodym derivative $dP_T/dP_S(z)$ belongs
  to a parametric class $\{g(z,\alpha), \alpha\in \mathcal{A}\}$ and that some (generalized)
  moments of $P_T$ are available to the learner, we propose a two-step learning procedure
  to perform the risk minimization task. We first select $\hat{\alpha}$ so as to match
  the moment constraints as closely as possible and then reweight each (biased) training
  observation $Z_i$ by $g(Z_i,\hat{\alpha})$ in the final Empirical Risk Minimization
  (ERM) algorithm. We establish a $O_{\mathbb{P}}(1/\sqrt{n})$ generalization bound
  proving that, remarkably, the solution to the weighted ERM problem thus constructed
  achieves a learning rate of the same order as that attained in absence of any sampling
  bias. Beyond these theoretical guarantees, numerical results providing strong empirical
  evidence of the relevance of the approach promoted in this article are displayed.
