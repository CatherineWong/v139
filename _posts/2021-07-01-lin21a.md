title: Making transport more robust and interpretable by moving data through a small
  number of anchor points
abstract: Optimal transport (OT) is a widely used technique for distribution alignment,
  with applications throughout the machine learning, graphics, and vision communities.
  Without any additional structural assumptions on transport, however, OT can be fragile
  to outliers or noise, especially in high dimensions. Here, we introduce Latent Optimal
  Transport (LOT), a new approach for OT that simultaneously learns low-dimensional
  structure in data while leveraging this structure to solve the alignment task. The
  idea behind our approach is to learn two sets of “anchors” that constrain the flow
  of transport between a source and target distribution. In both theoretical and empirical
  studies, we show that LOT regularizes the rank of transport and makes it more robust
  to outliers and the sampling density. We show that by allowing the source and target
  to have different anchors, and using LOT to align the latent spaces between anchors,
  the resulting transport plan has better structural interpretability and highlights
  connections between both the individual data points and the local geometry of the
  datasets.
