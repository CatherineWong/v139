title: 'HoroPCA: Hyperbolic Dimensionality Reduction via Horospherical Projections'
abstract: 'This paper studies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for data lying in
  hyperbolic spaces. Given directions, PCA relies on: (1) a parameterization of subspaces
  spanned by these directions, (2) a method of projection onto subspaces that preserves
  information in these directions, and (3) an objective to optimize, namely the variance
  explained by projections. We generalize each of these concepts to the hyperbolic
  space and propose HoroPCA, a method for hyperbolic dimensionality reduction. By
  focusing on the core problem of extracting principal directions, HoroPCA theoretically
  better preserves information in the original data such as distances, compared to
  previous generalizations of PCA. Empirically, we validate that HoroPCA outperforms
  existing dimensionality reduction methods, significantly reducing error in distance
  preservation. As a data whitening method, it improves downstream classification
  by up to 3.9% compared to methods that donâ€™t use whitening. Finally, we show that
  HoroPCA can be used to visualize hyperbolic data in two dimensions.'
