title: What Makes for End-to-End Object Detection?
abstract: 'Object detection has recently achieved a breakthrough for removing the
  last one non-differentiable component in the pipeline, Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS),
  and building up an end-to-end system. However, what makes for its one-to-one prediction
  has not been well understood. In this paper, we first point out that one-to-one
  positive sample assignment is the key factor, while, one-to-many assignment in previous
  detectors causes redundant predictions in inference. Second, we surprisingly find
  that even training with one-to-one assignment, previous detectors still produce
  redundant predictions. We identify that classification cost in matching cost is
  the main ingredient: (1) previous detectors only consider location cost, (2) by
  additionally introducing classification cost, previous detectors immediately produce
  one-to-one prediction during inference. We introduce the concept of score gap to
  explore the effect of matching cost. Classification cost enlarges the score gap
  by choosing positive samples as those of highest score in the training iteration
  and reducing noisy positive samples brought by only location cost. Finally, we demonstrate
  the advantages of end-to-end object detection on crowded scenes.'
