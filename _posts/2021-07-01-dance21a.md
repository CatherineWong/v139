title: Demonstration-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning for Few-Shot Imitation
abstract: In few-shot imitation, an agent is given a few demonstrations of a previously
  unseen task, and must then successfully perform that task. We propose a novel approach
  to learning few-shot-imitation agents that we call demonstration-conditioned reinforcement
  learning (DCRL). Given a training set consisting of demonstrations, reward functions
  and transition distributions for multiple tasks, the idea is to work with a policy
  that takes demonstrations as input, and to train this policy to maximize the average
  of the cumulative reward over the set of training tasks. Relative to previously
  proposed few-shot imitation methods that use behaviour cloning or infer reward functions
  from demonstrations, our method has the disadvantage that it requires reward functions
  at training time. However, DCRL also has several advantages, such as the ability
  to improve upon suboptimal demonstrations, to operate given state-only demonstrations,
  and to cope with a domain shift between the demonstrator and the agent. Moreover,
  we show that DCRL outperforms methods based on behaviour cloning by a large margin,
  on navigation tasks and on robotic manipulation tasks from the Meta-World benchmark.
