title: Neuro-algorithmic Policies Enable Fast Combinatorial Generalization
abstract: Although model-based and model-free approaches to learning the control of
  systems have achieved impressive results on standard benchmarks, generalization
  to task variations is still lacking. Recent results suggest that generalization
  for standard architectures improves only after obtaining exhaustive amounts of data.
  We give evidence that generalization capabilities are in many cases bottlenecked
  by the inability to generalize on the combinatorial aspects of the problem. We show
  that, for a certain subclass of the MDP framework, this can be alleviated by a neuro-algorithmic
  policy architecture that embeds a time-dependent shortest path solver in a deep
  neural network. Trained end-to-end via blackbox-differentiation, this method leads
  to considerable improvement in generalization capabilities in the low-data regime.
