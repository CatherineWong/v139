title: A Nullspace Property for Subspace-Preserving Recovery
abstract: Much of the theory for classical sparse recovery is based on conditions
  on the dictionary that are both necessary and sufficient (e.g., nullspace property)
  or only sufficient (e.g., incoherence and restricted isometry). In contrast, much
  of the theory for subspace-preserving recovery, the theoretical underpinnings for
  sparse subspace classification and clustering methods, is based on conditions on
  the subspaces and the data that are only sufficient (e.g., subspace incoherence
  and data inner-radius). This paper derives a necessary and sufficient condition
  for subspace-preserving recovery that is inspired by the classical nullspace property.Based
  on this novel condition, called here the subspace nullspace property, we derive
  equivalent characterizations that either admit a clear geometric interpretation
  that relates data distribution and subspace separation to the recovery success,
  or can be verified using a finite set of extreme points of a properly defined set.
  We further exploit these characterizations to derive new sufficient conditions,
  based on inner-radius and outer-radius measures and dual bounds, that generalize
  existing conditions and preserve the geometric interpretations. These results fill
  an important gap in the subspace-preserving recovery literature.
