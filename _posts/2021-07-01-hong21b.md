title: 'Chebyshev Polynomial Codes: Task Entanglement-based Coding for Distributed
  Matrix Multiplication'
abstract: Distributed computing has been a prominent solution to efficiently process
  massive datasets in parallel. However, the existence of stragglers is one of the
  major concerns that slows down the overall speed of distributed computing. To deal
  with this problem, we consider a distributed matrix multiplication scenario where
  a master assigns multiple tasks to each worker to exploit stragglersâ€™ computing
  ability (which is typically wasted in conventional distributed computing). We propose
  Chebyshev polynomial codes, which can achieve order-wise improvement in encoding
  complexity at the master and communication load in distributed matrix multiplication
  using task entanglement. The key idea of task entanglement is to reduce the number
  of encoded matrices for multiple tasks assigned to each worker by intertwining encoded
  matrices. We experimentally demonstrate that, in cloud environments, Chebyshev polynomial
  codes can provide significant reduction in overall processing time in distributed
  computing for matrix multiplication, which is a key computational component in modern
  deep learning.
