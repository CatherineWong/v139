title: Agnostic Learning of Halfspaces with Gradient Descent via Soft Margins
abstract: We analyze the properties of gradient descent on convex surrogates for the
  zero-one loss for the agnostic learning of halfspaces. We show that when a quantity
  we refer to as the \textit{soft margin} is well-behaved—a condition satisfied by
  log-concave isotropic distributions among others—minimizers of convex surrogates
  for the zero-one loss are approximate minimizers for the zero-one loss itself. As
  standard convex optimization arguments lead to efficient guarantees for minimizing
  convex surrogates of the zero-one loss, our methods allow for the first positive
  guarantees for the classification error of halfspaces learned by gradient descent
  using the binary cross-entropy or hinge loss in the presence of agnostic label noise.
