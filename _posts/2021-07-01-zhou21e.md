title: Towards Defending against Adversarial Examples via Attack-Invariant Features
abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial noise. Their adversarial
  robustness can be improved by exploiting adversarial examples. However, given the
  continuously evolving attacks, models trained on seen types of adversarial examples
  generally cannot generalize well to unseen types of adversarial examples. To solve
  this problem, in this paper, we propose to remove adversarial noise by learning
  generalizable invariant features across attacks which maintain semantic classification
  information. Specifically, we introduce an adversarial feature learning mechanism
  to disentangle invariant features from adversarial noise. A normalization term has
  been proposed in the encoded space of the attack-invariant features to address the
  bias issue between the seen and unseen types of attacks. Empirical evaluations demonstrate
  that our method could provide better protection in comparison to previous state-of-the-art
  approaches, especially against unseen types of attacks and adaptive attacks.
