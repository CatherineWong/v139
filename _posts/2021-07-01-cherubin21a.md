title: Exact Optimization of Conformal Predictors via Incremental and Decremental
  Learning
abstract: Conformal Predictors (CP) are wrappers around ML models, providing error
  guarantees under weak assumptions on the data distribution. They are suitable for
  a wide range of problems, from classification and regression to anomaly detection.
  Unfortunately, their very high computational complexity limits their applicability
  to large datasets. In this work, we show that it is possible to speed up a CP classifier
  considerably, by studying it in conjunction with the underlying ML method, and by
  exploiting incremental&decremental learning. For methods such as k-NN, KDE, and
  kernel LS-SVM, our approach reduces the running time by one order of magnitude,
  whilst producing exact solutions. With similar ideas, we also achieve a linear speed
  up for the harder case of bootstrapping. Finally, we extend these techniques to
  improve upon an optimization of k-NN CP for regression. We evaluate our findings
  empirically, and discuss when methods are suitable for CP optimization.
