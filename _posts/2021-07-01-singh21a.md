title: Structured World Belief for Reinforcement Learning in POMDP
abstract: Object-centric world models provide structured representation of the scene
  and can be an important backbone in reinforcement learning and planning. However,
  existing approaches suffer in partially-observable environments due to the lack
  of belief states. In this paper, we propose Structured World Belief, a model for
  learning and inference of object-centric belief states. Inferred by Sequential Monte
  Carlo (SMC), our belief states provide multiple object-centric scene hypotheses.
  To synergize the benefits of SMC particles with object representations, we also
  propose a new object-centric dynamics model that considers the inductive bias of
  object permanence. This enables tracking of object states even when they are invisible
  for a long time. To further facilitate object tracking in this regime, we allow
  our model to attend flexibly to any spatial location in the image which was restricted
  in previous models. In experiments, we show that object-centric belief provides
  a more accurate and robust performance for filtering and generation. Furthermore,
  we show the efficacy of structured world belief in improving the performance of
  reinforcement learning, planning and supervised reasoning.
