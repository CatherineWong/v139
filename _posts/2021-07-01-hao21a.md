title: Sparse Feature Selection Makes Batch Reinforcement Learning More Sample Efficient
abstract: This paper provides a statistical analysis of high-dimensional batch reinforcement
  learning (RL) using sparse linear function approximation. When there is a large
  number of candidate features, our result sheds light on the fact that sparsity-aware
  methods can make batch RL more sample efficient. We first consider the off-policy
  policy evaluation problem. To evaluate a new target policy, we analyze a Lasso fitted
  Q-evaluation method and establish a finite-sample error bound that has no polynomial
  dependence on the ambient dimension. To reduce the Lasso bias, we further propose
  a post model-selection estimator that applies fitted Q-evaluation to the features
  selected via group Lasso. Under an additional signal strength assumption, we derive
  a sharper instance-dependent error bound that depends on a divergence function measuring
  the distribution mismatch between the data distribution and occupancy measure of
  the target policy. Further, we study the Lasso fitted Q-iteration for batch policy
  optimization and establish a finite-sample error bound depending on the ratio between
  the number of relevant features and restricted minimal eigenvalue of the dataâ€™s
  covariance. In the end, we complement the results with minimax lower bounds for
  batch-data policy evaluation/optimization that nearly match our upper bounds. The
  results suggest that having well-conditioned data is crucial for sparse batch policy
  learning.
