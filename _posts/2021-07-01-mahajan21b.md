title: Domain Generalization using Causal Matching
abstract: 'In the domain generalization literature, a common objective is to learn
  representations independent of the domain after conditioning on the class label.
  We show that this objective is not sufficient: there exist counter-examples where
  a model fails to generalize to unseen domains even after satisfying class-conditional
  domain invariance. We formalize this observation through a structural causal model
  and show the importance of modeling within-class variations for generalization.
  Specifically, classes contain objects that characterize specific causal features,
  and domains can be interpreted as interventions on these objects that change non-causal
  features. We highlight an alternative condition: inputs across domains should have
  the same representation if they are derived from the same object. Based on this
  objective, we propose matching-based algorithms when base objects are observed (e.g.,
  through data augmentation) and approximate the objective when objects are not observed
  (MatchDG). Our simple matching-based algorithms are competitive to prior work on
  out-of-domain accuracy for rotated MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, PACS, and Chest-Xray datasets.
  Our method MatchDG also recovers ground-truth object matches: on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST,
  top-10 matches from MatchDG have over 50% overlap with ground-truth matches.'
