title: Gaussian Process-Based Real-Time Learning for Safety Critical Applications
abstract: The safe operation of physical systems typically relies on high-quality
  models. Since a continuous stream of data is generated during run-time, such models
  are often obtained through the application of Gaussian process regression because
  it provides guarantees on the prediction error. Due to its high computational complexity,
  Gaussian process regression must be used offline on batches of data, which prevents
  applications, where a fast adaptation through online learning is necessary to ensure
  safety. In order to overcome this issue, we propose the LoG-GP. It achieves a logarithmic
  update and prediction complexity in the number of training points through the aggregation
  of locally active Gaussian process models. Under weak assumptions on the aggregation
  scheme, it inherits safety guarantees from exact Gaussian process regression. These
  theoretical advantages are exemplarily exploited in the design of a safe and data-efficient,
  online-learning control policy. The efficiency and performance of the proposed real-time
  learning approach is demonstrated in a comparison to state-of-the-art methods.
