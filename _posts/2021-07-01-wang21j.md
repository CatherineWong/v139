title: Global Convergence of Policy Gradient for Linear-Quadratic Mean-Field Control/Game
  in Continuous Time
abstract: Recent years have witnessed the success of multi-agent reinforcement learning,
  which has motivated new research directions for mean-field control (MFC) and mean-field
  game (MFG), as the multi-agent system can be well approximated by a mean-field problem
  when the number of agents grows to be very large. In this paper, we study the policy
  gradient (PG) method for the linear-quadratic mean-field control and game, where
  we assume each agent has identical linear state transitions and quadratic cost functions.
  While most recent works on policy gradient for MFC and MFG are based on discrete-time
  models, we focus on a continuous-time model where some of our analyzing techniques
  could be valuable to the interested readers. For both the MFC and the MFG, we provide
  PG update and show that it converges to the optimal solution at a linear rate, which
  is verified by a synthetic simulation. For the MFG, we also provide sufficient conditions
  for the existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium.
