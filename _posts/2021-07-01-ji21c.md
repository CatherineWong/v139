title: 'Bilevel Optimization: Convergence Analysis and Enhanced Design'
abstract: Bilevel optimization has arisen as a powerful tool for many machine learning
  problems such as meta-learning, hyperparameter optimization, and reinforcement learning.
  In this paper, we investigate the nonconvex-strongly-convex bilevel optimization
  problem. For deterministic bilevel optimization, we provide a comprehensive convergence
  rate analysis for two popular algorithms respectively based on approximate implicit
  differentiation (AID) and iterative differentiation (ITD). For the AID-based method,
  we orderwisely improve the previous convergence rate analysis due to a more practical
  parameter selection as well as a warm start strategy, and for the ITD-based method
  we establish the first theoretical convergence rate. Our analysis also provides
  a quantitative comparison between ITD and AID based approaches. For stochastic bilevel
  optimization, we propose a novel algorithm named stocBiO, which features a sample-efficient
  hypergradient estimator using efficient Jacobian- and Hessian-vector product computations.
  We provide the convergence rate guarantee for stocBiO, and show that stocBiO outperforms
  the best known computational complexities orderwisely with respect to the condition
  number $\kappa$ and the target accuracy $\epsilon$. We further validate our theoretical
  results and demonstrate the efficiency of bilevel optimization algorithms by the
  experiments on meta-learning and hyperparameter optimization.
