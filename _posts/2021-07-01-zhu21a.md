title: Sparse and Imperceptible Adversarial Attack via a Homotopy Algorithm
abstract: 'Sparse adversarial attacks can fool deep neural networks (DNNs) by only
  perturbing a few pixels (regularized by $\ell_0$ norm). Recent efforts combine it
  with another $\ell_\infty$ imperceptible on the perturbation magnitudes. The resultant
  sparse and imperceptible attacks are practically relevant, and indicate an even
  higher vulnerability of DNNs that we usually imagined. However, such attacks are
  more challenging to generate due to the optimization difficulty by coupling the
  $\ell_0$ regularizer and box constraints with a non-convex objective. In this paper,
  we address this challenge by proposing a homotopy algorithm, to jointly tackle the
  sparsity and the perturbation bound in one unified framework. Each iteration, the
  main step of our algorithm is to optimize an $\ell_0$-regularized adversarial loss,
  by leveraging the nonmonotone Accelerated Proximal Gradient Method (nmAPG) for nonconvex
  programming; it is followed by an $\ell_0$ change control step, and an optional
  post-attack step designed to escape bad local minima. We also extend the algorithm
  to handling the structural sparsity regularizer. We extensively examine the effectiveness
  of our proposed \textbf{homotopy attack} for both targeted and non-targeted attack
  scenarios, on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. Compared to state-of-the-art methods,
  our homotopy attack leads to significantly fewer perturbations, e.g., reducing 42.91%
  on CIFAR-10 and 75.03% on ImageNet (average case, targeted attack), at similar maximal
  perturbation magnitudes, when still achieving 100% attack success rates. Our codes
  are available at: {\small\url{https://github.com/VITA-Group/SparseADV_Homotopy}}.'
