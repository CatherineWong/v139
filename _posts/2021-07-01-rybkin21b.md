title: Model-Based Reinforcement Learning via Latent-Space Collocation
abstract: The ability to plan into the future while utilizing only raw high-dimensional
  observations, such as images, can provide autonomous agents with broad and general
  capabilities. However, realistic tasks require performing temporally extended reasoning,
  and cannot be solved with only myopic, short-sighted planning. Recent work in model-based
  reinforcement learning (RL) has shown impressive results on tasks that require only
  short-horizon reasoning. In this work, we study how the long-horizon planning abilities
  can be improved with an algorithm that optimizes over sequences of states, rather
  than actions, which allows better credit assignment. To achieve this, we draw on
  the idea of collocation and adapt it to the image-based setting by leveraging probabilistic
  latent variable models, resulting in an algorithm that optimizes trajectories over
  latent variables. Our latent collocation method (LatCo) provides a general and effective
  visual planning approach, and significantly outperforms prior model-based approaches
  on challenging visual control tasks with sparse rewards and long-term goals. See
