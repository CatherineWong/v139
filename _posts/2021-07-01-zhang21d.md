title: Robust Policy Gradient against Strong Data Corruption
abstract: We study the problem of robust reinforcement learning under adversarial
  corruption on both rewards and transitions. Our attack model assumes an \textit{adaptive}
  adversary who can arbitrarily corrupt the reward and transition at every step within
  an episode, for at most $\epsilon$-fraction of the learning episodes. Our attack
  model is strictly stronger than those considered in prior works. Our first result
  shows that no algorithm can find a better than $O(\epsilon)$-optimal policy under
  our attack model. Next, we show that surprisingly the natural policy gradient (NPG)
  method retains a natural robustness property if the reward corruption is bounded,
  and can find an $O(\sqrt{\epsilon})$-optimal policy. Consequently, we develop a
  Filtered Policy Gradient (FPG) algorithm that can tolerate even unbounded reward
  corruption and can find an $O(\epsilon^{1/4})$-optimal policy. We emphasize that
  FPG is the first that can achieve a meaningful learning guarantee when a constant
  fraction of episodes are corrupted. Complimentary to the theoretical results, we
  show that a neural implementation of FPG achieves strong robust learning performance
  on the MuJoCo continuous control benchmarks.
