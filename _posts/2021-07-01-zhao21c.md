title: 'Calibrate Before Use: Improving Few-shot Performance of Language Models'
abstract: 'GPT-3 can perform numerous tasks when provided a natural language prompt
  that contains a few training examples. We show that this type of few-shot learning
  can be unstable: the choice of prompt format, training examples, and even the order
  of the examples can cause accuracy to vary from near chance to near state-of-the-art.
  We demonstrate that this instability arises from the bias of language models towards
  predicting certain answers, e.g., those that are placed near the end of the prompt
  or are common in the pre-training data. To mitigate this, we first estimate the
  model’s bias towards each answer by asking for its prediction when given a training
  prompt and a content-free test input such as "N/A". We then fit calibration parameters
  that cause the prediction for this input to be uniform across answers. On a diverse
  set of tasks, this contextual calibration procedure substantially improves GPT-3
  and GPT-2’s accuracy (up to 30.0% absolute) across different choices of the prompt,
  while also making learning considerably more stable.'
