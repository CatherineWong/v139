title: Directional Bias Amplification
abstract: 'Mitigating bias in machine learning systems requires refining our understanding
  of bias propagation pathways: from societal structures to large-scale data to trained
  models to impact on society. In this work, we focus on one aspect of the problem,
  namely bias amplification: the tendency of models to amplify the biases present
  in the data they are trained on. A metric for measuring bias amplification was introduced
  in the seminal work by Zhao et al. (2017); however, as we demonstrate, this metric
  suffers from a number of shortcomings including conflating different types of bias
  amplification and failing to account for varying base rates of protected attributes.
  We introduce and analyze a new, decoupled metric for measuring bias amplification,
  $BiasAmp_{\rightarrow}$ (Directional Bias Amplification). We thoroughly analyze
  and discuss both the technical assumptions and normative implications of this metric.
  We provide suggestions about its measurement by cautioning against predicting sensitive
  attributes, encouraging the use of confidence intervals due to fluctuations in the
  fairness of models across runs, and discussing the limitations of what this metric
  captures. Throughout this paper, we work to provide an interrogative look at the
  technical measurement of bias amplification, guided by our normative ideas of what
  we want it to encompass. Code is located at https://github.com/princetonvisualai/directional-bias-amp.'
