title: 'Principal Bit Analysis: Autoencoding with Schur-Concave Loss'
abstract: We consider a linear autoencoder in which the latent variables are quantized,
  or corrupted by noise, and the constraint is Schur-concave in the set of latent
  variances. Although finding the optimal encoder/decoder pair for this setup is a
  nonconvex optimization problem, we show that decomposing the source into its principal
  components is optimal. If the constraint is strictly Schur-concave and the empirical
  covariance matrix has only simple eigenvalues, then any optimal encoder/decoder
  must decompose the source in this way. As one application, we consider a strictly
  Schur-concave constraint that estimates the number of bits needed to represent the
  latent variables under fixed-rate encoding, a setup that we call \emph{Principal
  Bit Analysis (PBA)}. This yields a practical, general-purpose, fixed-rate compressor
  that outperforms existing algorithms. As a second application, we show that a prototypical
  autoencoder-based variable-rate compressor is guaranteed to decompose the source
  into its principal components.
