title: 'iDARTS: Differentiable Architecture Search with Stochastic Implicit Gradients'
abstract: Differentiable ARchiTecture Search(DARTS) has recently become the mainstream
  in the neural architecture search (NAS) due to its efficiency and simplicity. With
  a gradient-based bi-level optimization, DARTS alternately optimizes the inner model
  weights and the outer architecture parameter in a weight-sharing supernet. A key
  challenge to the scalability and quality of the learned architectures is the need
  for differentiating through the inner-loop optimisation. While much has been discussed
  about several potentially fatal factors in DARTS, the architecture gradient, a.k.a.
  hypergradient, has received less attention. In this paper, we tackle the hypergradient
  computation in DARTS based on the implicit function theorem, making it only depends
  on the obtained solution to the inner-loop optimization and agnostic to the optimization
  path. To further reduce the computational requirements, we formulate a stochastic
  hypergradient approximation for differentiable NAS, and theoretically show that
  the architecture optimization with the proposed method is expected to converge to
  a stationary point. Comprehensive experiments on two NAS benchmark search spaces
  and the common NAS search space verify the effectiveness of our proposed method.
  It leads to architectures outperforming, with large margins, those learned by the
  baseline methods.
