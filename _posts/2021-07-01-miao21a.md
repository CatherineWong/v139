title: 'EfficientTTS: An Efficient and High-Quality Text-to-Speech Architecture'
abstract: In this work, we address the Text-to-Speech (TTS) task by proposing a non-autoregressive
  architecture called EfficientTTS. Unlike the dominant non-autoregressive TTS models,
  which are trained with the need of external aligners, EfficientTTS optimizes all
  its parameters with a stable, end-to-end training procedure, allowing for synthesizing
  high quality speech in a fast and efficient manner. EfficientTTS is motivated by
  a new monotonic alignment modeling approach, which specifies monotonic constraints
  to the sequence alignment with almost no increase of computation. By combining EfficientTTS
  with different feed-forward network structures, we develop a family of TTS models,
  including both text-to-melspectrogram and text-to-waveform networks. We experimentally
  show that the proposed models significantly outperform counterpart models such as
  Tacotron 2 and Glow-TTS in terms of speech quality, training efficiency and synthesis
  speed, while still producing the speeches of strong robustness and great diversity.
  In addition, we demonstrate that proposed approach can be easily extended to autoregressive
  models such as Tacotron 2.
