title: Leveraging Sparse Linear Layers for Debuggable Deep Networks
abstract: We show how fitting sparse linear models over learned deep feature representations
  can lead to more debuggable neural networks. These networks remain highly accurate
  while also being more amenable to human interpretation, as we demonstrate quantitatively
  and via human experiments. We further illustrate how the resulting sparse explanations
  can help to identify spurious correlations, explain misclassifications, and diagnose
  model biases in vision and language tasks.
