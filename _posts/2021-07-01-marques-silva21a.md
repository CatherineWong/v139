title: Explanations for Monotonic Classifiers.
abstract: In many classification tasks there is a requirement of monotonicity. Concretely,
  if all else remains constant, increasing (resp. decreasing) the value of one or
  more features must not decrease (resp. increase) the value of the prediction. Despite
  comprehensive efforts on learning monotonic classifiers, dedicated approaches for
  explaining monotonic classifiers are scarce and classifier-specific. This paper
  describes novel algorithms for the computation of one formal explanation of a (black-box)
  monotonic classifier. These novel algorithms are polynomial (indeed linear) in the
  run time complexity of the classifier. Furthermore, the paper presents a practically
  efficient model-agnostic algorithm for enumerating formal explanations.
