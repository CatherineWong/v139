title: 'Class2Simi: A Noise Reduction Perspective on Learning with Noisy Labels'
abstract: 'Learning with noisy labels has attracted a lot of attention in recent years,
  where the mainstream approaches are in \emph{pointwise} manners. Meanwhile, \emph{pairwise}
  manners have shown great potential in supervised metric learning and unsupervised
  contrastive learning. Thus, a natural question is raised: does learning in a pairwise
  manner \emph{mitigate} label noise? To give an affirmative answer, in this paper,
  we propose a framework called \emph{Class2Simi}: it transforms data points with
  noisy \emph{class labels} to data pairs with noisy \emph{similarity labels}, where
  a similarity label denotes whether a pair shares the class label or not. Through
  this transformation, the \emph{reduction of the noise rate} is theoretically guaranteed,
  and hence it is in principle easier to handle noisy similarity labels. Amazingly,
  DNNs that predict the \emph{clean} class labels can be trained from noisy data pairs
  if they are first pretrained from noisy data points. Class2Simi is \emph{computationally
  efficient} because not only this transformation is on-the-fly in mini-batches, but
  also it just changes loss computation on top of model prediction into a pairwise
  manner. Its effectiveness is verified by extensive experiments.'
