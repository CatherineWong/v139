title: Provable Meta-Learning of Linear Representations
abstract: Meta-learning, or learning-to-learn, seeks to design algorithms that can
  utilize previous experience to rapidly learn new skills or adapt to new environments.
  Representation learning—a key tool for performing meta-learning—learns a data representation
  that can transfer knowledge across multiple tasks, which is essential in regimes
  where data is scarce. Despite a recent surge of interest in the practice of meta-learning,
  the theoretical underpinnings of meta-learning algorithms are lacking, especially
  in the context of learning transferable representations. In this paper, we focus
  on the problem of multi-task linear regression—in which multiple linear regression
  models share a common, low-dimensional linear representation. Here, we provide provably
  fast, sample-efficient algorithms to address the dual challenges of (1) learning
  a common set of features from multiple, related tasks, and (2) transferring this
  knowledge to new, unseen tasks. Both are central to the general problem of meta-learning.
  Finally, we complement these results by providing information-theoretic lower bounds
  on the sample complexity of learning these linear features.
