title: Probabilistic Generating Circuits
abstract: Generating functions, which are widely used in combinatorics and probability
  theory, encode function values into the coefficients of a polynomial. In this paper,
  we explore their use as a tractable probabilistic model, and propose probabilistic
  generating circuits (PGCs) for their efficient representation. PGCs are strictly
  more expressive efficient than many existing tractable probabilistic models, including
  determinantal point processes (DPPs), probabilistic circuits (PCs) such as sum-product
  networks, and tractable graphical models. We contend that PGCs are not just a theoretical
  framework that unifies vastly different existing models, but also show great potential
  in modeling realistic data. We exhibit a simple class of PGCs that are not trivially
  subsumed by simple combinations of PCs and DPPs, and obtain competitive performance
  on a suite of density estimation benchmarks. We also highlight PGCsâ€™ connection
  to the theory of strongly Rayleigh distributions.
