title: Asymmetric Loss Functions for Learning with Noisy Labels
abstract: Robust loss functions are essential for training deep neural networks with
  better generalization power in the presence of noisy labels. Symmetric loss functions
  are confirmed to be robust to label noise. However, the symmetric condition is overly
  restrictive. In this work, we propose a new class of loss functions, namely asymmetric
  loss functions, which are robust to learning from noisy labels for arbitrary noise
  type. Subsequently, we investigate general theoretical properties of asymmetric
  loss functions, including classification-calibration, excess risk bound, and noise-tolerance.
  Meanwhile, we introduce the asymmetry ratio to measure the asymmetry of a loss function,
  and the empirical results show that a higher ratio will provide better robustness.
  Moreover, we modify several common loss functions, and establish the necessary and
  sufficient conditions for them to be asymmetric. Experiments on benchmark datasets
  demonstrate that asymmetric loss functions can outperform state-of-the-art methods.
