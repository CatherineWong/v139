title: Accumulated Decoupled Learning with Gradient Staleness Mitigation for Convolutional
  Neural Networks
abstract: Gradient staleness is a major side effect in decoupled learning when training
  convolutional neural networks asynchronously. Existing methods that ignore this
  effect might result in reduced generalization and even divergence. In this paper,
  we propose an accumulated decoupled learning (ADL), which includes a module-wise
  gradient accumulation in order to mitigate the gradient staleness. Unlike prior
  arts ignoring the gradient staleness, we quantify the staleness in such a way that
  its mitigation can be quantitatively visualized. As a new learning scheme, the proposed
  ADL is theoretically shown to converge to critical points in spite of its asynchronism.
  Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets are conducted, demonstrating
  that ADL gives promising generalization results while the state-of-the-art methods
  experience reduced generalization and divergence. In addition, our ADL is shown
  to have the fastest training speed among the compared methods.
