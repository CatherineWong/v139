title: Towards the Unification and Robustness of Perturbation and Gradient Based Explanations
abstract: 'As machine learning black boxes are increasingly being deployed in critical
  domains such as healthcare and criminal justice, there has been a growing emphasis
  on developing techniques for explaining these black boxes in a post hoc manner.
  In this work, we analyze two popular post hoc interpretation techniques: SmoothGrad
  which is a gradient based method, and a variant of LIME which is a perturbation
  based method. More specifically, we derive explicit closed form expressions for
  the explanations output by these two methods and show that they both converge to
  the same explanation in expectation, i.e., when the number of perturbed samples
  used by these methods is large. We then leverage this connection to establish other
  desirable properties, such as robustness, for these techniques. We also derive finite
  sample complexity bounds for the number of perturbations required for these methods
  to converge to their expected explanation. Finally, we empirically validate our
  theory using extensive experimentation on both synthetic and real-world datasets.'
