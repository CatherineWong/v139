title: Quantum algorithms for reinforcement learning with a generative model
abstract: 'Reinforcement learning studies how an agent should interact with an environment
  to maximize its cumulative reward. A standard way to study this question abstractly
  is to ask how many samples an agent needs from the environment to learn an optimal
  policy for a $\gamma$-discounted Markov decision process (MDP). For such an MDP,
  we design quantum algorithms that approximate an optimal policy ($\pi^*$), the optimal
  value function ($v^*$), and the optimal $Q$-function ($q^*$), assuming the algorithms
  can access samples from the environment in quantum superposition. This assumption
  is justified whenever there exists a simulator for the environment; for example,
  if the environment is a video game or some other program. Our quantum algorithms,
  inspired by value iteration, achieve quadratic speedups over the best-possible classical
  sample complexities in the approximation accuracy ($\epsilon$) and two main parameters
  of the MDP: the effective time horizon ($\frac{1}{1-\gamma}$) and the size of the
  action space ($A$). Moreover, we show that our quantum algorithm for computing $q^*$
  is optimal by proving a matching quantum lower bound.'
