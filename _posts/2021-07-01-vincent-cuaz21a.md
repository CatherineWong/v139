title: Online Graph Dictionary Learning
abstract: Dictionary learning is a key tool for representation learning, that explains
  the data as linear combination of few basic elements. Yet, this analysis is not
  amenable in the context of graph learning, as graphs usually belong to different
  metric spaces. We fill this gap by proposing a new online Graph Dictionary Learning
  approach, which uses the Gromov Wasserstein divergence for the data fitting term.
  In our work, graphs are encoded through their nodes’ pairwise relations and modeled
  as convex combination of graph atoms, i.e. dictionary elements, estimated thanks
  to an online stochastic algorithm, which operates on a dataset of unregistered graphs
  with potentially different number of nodes. Our approach naturally extends to labeled
  graphs, and is completed by a novel upper bound that can be used as a fast approximation
  of Gromov Wasserstein in the embedding space. We provide numerical evidences showing
  the interest of our approach for unsupervised embedding of graph datasets and for
  online graph subspace estimation and tracking.
