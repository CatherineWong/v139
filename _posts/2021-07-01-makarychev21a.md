title: Near-Optimal Algorithms for Explainable k-Medians and k-Means
abstract: 'We consider the problem of explainable $k$-medians and $k$-means introduced
  by Dasgupta, Frost, Moshkovitz, and RashtchianÂ (ICML 2020). In this problem, our
  goal is to find a \emph{threshold decision tree} that partitions data into $k$ clusters
  and minimizes the $k$-medians or $k$-means objective. The obtained clustering is
  easy to interpret because every decision node of a threshold tree splits data based
  on a single feature into two groups. We propose a new algorithm for this problem
  which is $\tilde O(\log k)$ competitive with $k$-medians with $\ell_1$ norm and
  $\tilde O(k)$ competitive with $k$-means. This is an improvement over the previous
  guarantees of $O(k)$ and $O(k^2)$ by Dasgupta et al (2020). We also provide a new
  algorithm which is $O(\log^{\nicefrac{3}{2}} k)$ competitive for $k$-medians with
  $\ell_2$ norm. Our first algorithm is near-optimal: Dasgupta et al (2020) showed
  a lower bound of $\Omega(\log k)$ for $k$-medians; in this work, we prove a lower
  bound of $\tilde\Omega(k)$ for $k$-means. We also provide a lower bound of $\Omega(\log
  k)$ for $k$-medians with $\ell_2$ norm.'
