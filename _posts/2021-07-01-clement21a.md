title: First-Order Methods for Wasserstein Distributionally Robust MDP
abstract: Markov decision processes (MDPs) are known to be sensitive to parameter
  specification. Distributionally robust MDPs alleviate this issue by allowing for
  \textit{ambiguity sets} which give a set of possible distributions over parameter
  sets. The goal is to find an optimal policy with respect to the worst-case parameter
  distribution. We propose a framework for solving Distributionally robust MDPs via
  first-order methods, and instantiate it for several types of Wasserstein ambiguity
  sets. By developing efficient proximal updates, our algorithms achieve a convergence
  rate of $O\left(NA^{2.5}S^{3.5}\log(S)\log(\epsilon^{-1})\epsilon^{-1.5} \right)$
  for the number of kernels $N$ in the support of the nominal distribution, states
  $S$, and actions $A$; this rate varies slightly based on the Wasserstein setup.
  Our dependence on $N,A$ and $S$ is significantly better than existing methods, which
  have a complexity of $O\left(N^{3.5}A^{3.5}S^{4.5}\log^{2}(\epsilon^{-1}) \right)$.
  Numerical experiments show that our algorithm is significantly more scalable than
  state-of-the-art approaches across several domains.
