title: Fundamental Tradeoffs in Distributionally Adversarial Training
abstract: 'Adversarial training is among the most effective techniques to improve
  robustness of models against adversarial perturbations. However, the full effect
  of this approach on models is not well understood. For example, while adversarial
  training can reduce the adversarial risk (prediction error against an adversary),
  it sometimes increase standard risk (generalization error when there is no adversary).
  In this paper, we focus on \emph{distribution perturbing} adversary framework wherein
  the adversary can change the test distribution within a neighborhood of the training
  data distribution. The neighborhood is defined via Wasserstein distance between
  distributions and the radius of the neighborhood is a measure of adversary’s manipulative
  power. We study the tradeoff between standard risk and adversarial risk and derive
  the Pareto-optimal tradeoff, achievable over specific classes of models, in the
  infinite data limit with features dimension kept fixed. We consider three learning
  settings: 1) Regression with the class of linear models; 2) Binary classification
  under the Gaussian mixtures data model, with the class of linear classifiers; 3)
  Regression with the class of random features model (which can be equivalently represented
  as two-layer neural network with random first-layer weights). We show that a tradeoff
  between standard and adversarial risk is manifested in all three settings. We further
  characterize the Pareto-optimal tradeoff curves and discuss how a variety of factors,
  such as features correlation, adversary’s power or the width of two-layer neural
  network would affect this tradeoff.'
