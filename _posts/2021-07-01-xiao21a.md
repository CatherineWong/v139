title: 'A Bit More Bayesian: Domain-Invariant Learning with Uncertainty'
abstract: Domain generalization is challenging due to the domain shift and the uncertainty
  caused by the inaccessibility of target domain data. In this paper, we address both
  challenges with a probabilistic framework based on variational Bayesian inference,
  by incorporating uncertainty into neural network weights. We couple domain invariance
  in a probabilistic formula with the variational Bayesian inference. This enables
  us to explore domain-invariant learning in a principled way. Specifically, we derive
  domain-invariant representations and classifiers, which are jointly established
  in a two-layer Bayesian neural network. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness
  of our proposal on four widely used cross-domain visual recognition benchmarks.
  Ablation studies validate the synergistic benefits of our Bayesian treatment when
  jointly learning domain-invariant representations and classifiers for domain generalization.
  Further, our method consistently delivers state-of-the-art mean accuracy on all
  benchmarks.
