title: Reinforcement Learning for Cost-Aware Markov Decision Processes
abstract: Ratio maximization has applications in areas as diverse as finance, reward
  shaping for reinforcement learning (RL), and the development of safe artificial
  intelligence, yet there has been very little exploration of RL algorithms for ratio
  maximization. This paper addresses this deficiency by introducing two new, model-free
  RL algorithms for solving cost-aware Markov decision processes, where the goal is
  to maximize the ratio of long-run average reward to long-run average cost. The first
  algorithm is a two-timescale scheme based on relative value iteration (RVI) Q-learning
  and the second is an actor-critic scheme. The paper proves almost sure convergence
  of the former to the globally optimal solution in the tabular case and almost sure
  convergence of the latter under linear function approximation for the critic. Unlike
  previous methods, the two algorithms provably converge for general reward and cost
  functions under suitable conditions. The paper also provides empirical results demonstrating
  promising performance and lending strong support to the theoretical results.
