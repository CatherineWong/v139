title: Interpretable Stability Bounds for Spectral Graph Filters
abstract: Graph-structured data arise in a variety of real-world context ranging from
  sensor and transportation to biological and social networks. As a ubiquitous tool
  to process graph-structured data, spectral graph filters have been used to solve
  common tasks such as denoising and anomaly detection, as well as design deep learning
  architectures such as graph neural networks. Despite being an important tool, there
  is a lack of theoretical understanding of the stability properties of spectral graph
  filters, which are important for designing robust machine learning models. In this
  paper, we study filter stability and provide a novel and interpretable upper bound
  on the change of filter output, where the bound is expressed in terms of the endpoint
  degrees of the deleted and newly added edges, as well as the spatial proximity of
  those edges. This upper bound allows us to reason, in terms of structural properties
  of the graph, when a spectral graph filter will be stable. We further perform extensive
  experiments to verify intuition that can be gained from the bound.
