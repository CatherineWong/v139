title: Scalable Certified Segmentation via Randomized Smoothing
abstract: We present a new certification method for image and point cloud segmentation
  based on randomized smoothing. The method leverages a novel scalable algorithm for
  prediction and certification that correctly accounts for multiple testing, necessary
  for ensuring statistical guarantees. The key to our approach is reliance on established
  multiple-testing correction mechanisms as well as the ability to abstain from classifying
  single pixels or points while still robustly segmenting the overall input. Our experimental
  evaluation on synthetic data and challenging datasets, such as Pascal Context, Cityscapes,
  and ShapeNet, shows that our algorithm can achieve, for the first time, competitive
  accuracy and certification guarantees on real-world segmentation tasks. We provide
  an implementation at https://github.com/eth-sri/segmentation-smoothing.
