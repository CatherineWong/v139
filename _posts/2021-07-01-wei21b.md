title: Inferring serial correlation with dynamic backgrounds
abstract: Sequential data with serial correlation and an unknown, unstructured, and
  dynamic background is ubiquitous in neuroscience, psychology, and econometrics.
  Inferring serial correlation for such data is a fundamental challenge in statistics.
  We propose a Total Variation (TV) constrained least square estimator coupled with
  hypothesis tests to infer the serial correlation in the presence of unknown and
  unstructured dynamic background. The TV constraint on the dynamic background encourages
  a piecewise constant structure, which can approximate a wide range of dynamic backgrounds.
  The tuning parameter is selected via the Ljung-Box test to control the bias-variance
  trade-off. We establish a non-asymptotic upper bound for the estimation error through
  variational inequalities. We also derive a lower error bound via Fanoâ€™s method and
  show the proposed method is near-optimal. Numerical simulation and a real study
  in psychology demonstrate the excellent performance of our proposed method compared
  with the state-of-the-art.
