title: 'CURI: A Benchmark for Productive Concept Learning Under Uncertainty'
abstract: Humans can learn and reason under substantial uncertainty in a space of
  infinitely many compositional, productive concepts. For example, if a scene with
  two blue spheres qualifies as “daxy,” one can reason that the underlying concept
  may require scenes to have “only blue spheres” or “only spheres” or “only two objects.”
  In contrast, standard benchmarks for compositional reasoning do not explicitly capture
  a notion of reasoning under uncertainty or evaluate compositional concept acquisition.
  We introduce a new benchmark, Compositional Reasoning Under Uncertainty (CURI) that
  instantiates a series of few-shot, meta-learning tasks in a productive concept space
  to evaluate different aspects of systematic generalization under uncertainty, including
  splits that test abstract understandings of disentangling, productive generalization,
  learning boolean operations, variable binding, etc. Importantly, we also contribute
  a model-independent “compositionality gap” to evaluate the difficulty of generalizing
  out-of-distribution along each of these axes, allowing objective comparison of the
  difficulty of each compositional split. Evaluations across a range of modeling choices
  and splits reveal substantial room for improvement on the proposed benchmark.
