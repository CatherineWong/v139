title: Conditional Variational Autoencoder with Adversarial Learning for End-to-End
  Text-to-Speech
abstract: Several recent end-to-end text-to-speech (TTS) models enabling single-stage
  training and parallel sampling have been proposed, but their sample quality does
  not match that of two-stage TTS systems. In this work, we present a parallel end-to-end
  TTS method that generates more natural sounding audio than current two-stage models.
  Our method adopts variational inference augmented with normalizing flows and an
  adversarial training process, which improves the expressive power of generative
  modeling. We also propose a stochastic duration predictor to synthesize speech with
  diverse rhythms from input text. With the uncertainty modeling over latent variables
  and the stochastic duration predictor, our method expresses the natural one-to-many
  relationship in which a text input can be spoken in multiple ways with different
  pitches and rhythms. A subjective human evaluation (mean opinion score, or MOS)
  on the LJ Speech, a single speaker dataset, shows that our method outperforms the
  best publicly available TTS systems and achieves a MOS comparable to ground truth.
