title: Bayesian Deep Learning via Subnetwork Inference
abstract: 'The Bayesian paradigm has the potential to solve core issues of deep neural
  networks such as poor calibration and data inefficiency. Alas, scaling Bayesian
  inference to large weight spaces often requires restrictive approximations. In this
  work, we show that it suffices to perform inference over a small subset of model
  weights in order to obtain accurate predictive posteriors. The other weights are
  kept as point estimates. This subnetwork inference framework enables us to use expressive,
  otherwise intractable, posterior approximations over such subsets. In particular,
  we implement subnetwork linearized Laplace as a simple, scalable Bayesian deep learning
  method: We first obtain a MAP estimate of all weights and then infer a full-covariance
  Gaussian posterior over a subnetwork using the linearized Laplace approximation.
  We propose a subnetwork selection strategy that aims to maximally preserve the modelâ€™s
  predictive uncertainty. Empirically, our approach compares favorably to ensembles
  and less expressive posterior approximations over full networks.'
