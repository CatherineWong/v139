title: 'Bilinear Classes: A Structural Framework for Provable Generalization in RL'
abstract: 'This work introduces Bilinear Classes, a new structural framework, which
  permit generalization in reinforcement learning in a wide variety of settings through
  the use of function approximation. The framework incorporates nearly all existing
  models in which a polynomial sample complexity is achievable, and, notably, also
  includes new models, such as the Linear Q*/V* model in which both the optimal Q-function
  and the optimal V-function are linear in some known feature space. Our main result
  provides an RL algorithm which has polynomial sample complexity for Bilinear Classes;
  notably, this sample complexity is stated in terms of a reduction to the generalization
  error of an underlying supervised learning sub-problem. These bounds nearly match
  the best known sample complexity bounds for existing models. Furthermore, this framework
  also extends to the infinite dimensional (RKHS) setting: for the the Linear Q*/V*
  model, linear MDPs, and linear mixture MDPs, we provide sample complexities that
  have no explicit dependence on the explicit feature dimension (which could be infinite),
  but instead depends only on information theoretic quantities.'
