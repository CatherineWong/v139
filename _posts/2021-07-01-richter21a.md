title: Solving high-dimensional parabolic PDEs using the tensor train format
abstract: 'High-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) are ubiquitous in
  economics, science and engineering. However, their numerical treatment poses formidable
  challenges since traditional grid-based methods tend to be frustrated by the curse
  of dimensionality. In this paper, we argue that tensor trains provide an appealing
  approximation framework for parabolic PDEs: the combination of reformulations in
  terms of backward stochastic differential equations and regression-type methods
  in the tensor format holds the promise of leveraging latent low-rank structures
  enabling both compression and efficient computation. Following this paradigm, we
  develop novel iterative schemes, involving either explicit and fast or implicit
  and accurate updates. We demonstrate in a number of examples that our methods achieve
  a favorable trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency in comparison
  with state-of-the-art neural network based approaches.'
