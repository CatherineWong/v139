title: Differentially Private Correlation Clustering
abstract: Correlation clustering is a widely used technique in unsupervised machine
  learning. Motivated by applications where individual privacy is a concern, we initiate
  the study of differentially private correlation clustering. We propose an algorithm
  that achieves subquadratic additive error compared to the optimal cost. In contrast,
  straightforward adaptations of existing non-private algorithms all lead to a trivial
  quadratic error. Finally, we give a lower bound showing that any pure differentially
  private algorithm for correlation clustering requires additive error $\Omega$(n).
