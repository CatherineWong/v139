title: 'Revisiting Rainbow: Promoting more insightful and inclusive deep reinforcement
  learning research'
abstract: Since the introduction of DQN, a vast majority of reinforcement learning
  research has focused on reinforcement learning with deep neural networks as function
  approximators. New methods are typically evaluated on a set of environments that
  have now become standard, such as Atari 2600 games. While these benchmarks help
  standardize evaluation, their computational cost has the unfortunate side effect
  of widening the gap between those with ample access to computational resources,
  and those without. In this work we argue that, despite the communityâ€™s emphasis
  on large-scale environments, the traditional small-scale environments can still
  yield valuable scientific insights and can help reduce the barriers to entry for
  underprivileged communities. To substantiate our claims, we empirically revisit
  the paper which introduced the Rainbow algorithm [Hessel et al., 2018] and present
  some new insights into the algorithms used by Rainbow.
