title: Adapting to Delays and Data in Adversarial Multi-Armed Bandits
abstract: We consider the adversarial multi-armed bandit problem under delayed feedback.
  We analyze variants of the Exp3 algorithm that tune their step size using only information
  (about the losses and delays) available at the time of the decisions, and obtain
  regret guarantees that adapt to the observed (rather than the worst-case) sequences
  of delays and/or losses. First, through a remarkably simple proof technique, we
  show that with proper tuning of the step size, the algorithm achieves an optimal
  (up to logarithmic factors) regret of order $\sqrt{\log(K)(TK + D)}$ both in expectation
  and in high probability, where $K$ is the number of arms, $T$ is the time horizon,
  and $D$ is the cumulative delay. The high-probability version of the bound, which
  is the first high-probability delay-adaptive bound in the literature, crucially
  depends on the use of implicit exploration in estimating the losses. Then, following
  Zimmert and Seldin (2019), we extend these results so that the algorithm can “skip”
  rounds with large delays, resulting in regret bounds of order $\sqrt{TK\log(K)}
  + |R| + \sqrt{D_{\bar{R}}\log(K)}$, where $R$ is an arbitrary set of rounds (which
  are skipped) and $D_{\bar{R}}$ is the cumulative delay of the feedback for other
  rounds. Finally, we present another, data-adaptive (AdaGrad-style) version of the
  algorithm for which the regret adapts to the observed (delayed) losses instead of
  only adapting to the cumulative delay (this algorithm requires an a priori upper
  bound on the maximum delay, or the advance knowledge of the delay for each decision
  when it is made). The resulting bound can be orders of magnitude smaller on benign
  problems, and it can be shown that the delay only affects the regret through the
  loss of the best arm.
