title: Generalizable Episodic Memory for Deep Reinforcement Learning
abstract: Episodic memory-based methods can rapidly latch onto past successful strategies
  by a non-parametric memory and improve sample efficiency of traditional reinforcement
  learning. However, little effort is put into the continuous domain, where a state
  is never visited twice, and previous episodic methods fail to efficiently aggregate
  experience across trajectories. To address this problem, we propose Generalizable
  Episodic Memory (GEM), which effectively organizes the state-action values of episodic
  memory in a generalizable manner and supports implicit planning on memorized trajectories.
  GEM utilizes a double estimator to reduce the overestimation bias induced by value
  propagation in the planning process. Empirical evaluation shows that our method
  significantly outperforms existing trajectory-based methods on various MuJoCo continuous
  control tasks. To further show the general applicability, we evaluate our method
  on Atari games with discrete action space, which also shows a significant improvement
  over baseline algorithms.
