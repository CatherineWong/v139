title: 'ADOM: Accelerated Decentralized Optimization Method for Time-Varying Networks'
abstract: We propose ADOM â€“ an accelerated method for smooth and strongly convex decentralized
  optimization over time-varying networks. ADOM uses a dual oracle, i.e., we assume
  access to the gradient of the Fenchel conjugate of the individual loss functions.
  Up to a constant factor, which depends on the network structure only, its communication
  complexity is the same as that of accelerated Nesterov gradient method. To the best
  of our knowledge, only the algorithm of Rogozin et al. (2019) has a convergence
  rate with similar properties. However, their algorithm converges under the very
  restrictive assumption that the number of network changes can not be greater than
  a tiny percentage of the number of iterations. This assumption is hard to satisfy
  in practice, as the network topology changes usually can not be controlled. In contrast,
  ADOM merely requires the network to stay connected throughout time.
