title: Elastic Graph Neural Networks
abstract: While many existing graph neural networks (GNNs) have been proven to perform
  $\ell_2$-based graph smoothing that enforces smoothness globally, in this work we
  aim to further enhance the local smoothness adaptivity of GNNs via $\ell_1$-based
  graph smoothing. As a result, we introduce a family of GNNs (Elastic GNNs) based
  on $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$-based graph smoothing. In particular, we propose a novel
  and general message passing scheme into GNNs. This message passing algorithm is
  not only friendly to back-propagation training but also achieves the desired smoothing
  properties with a theoretical convergence guarantee. Experiments on semi-supervised
  learning tasks demonstrate that the proposed Elastic GNNs obtain better adaptivity
  on benchmark datasets and are significantly robust to graph adversarial attacks.
  The implementation of Elastic GNNs is available at \url{https://github.com/lxiaorui/ElasticGNN}.
