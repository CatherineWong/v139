title: Learning Stochastic Behaviour from Aggregate Data
abstract: Learning nonlinear dynamics from aggregate data is a challenging problem
  because the full trajectory of each individual is not available, namely, the individual
  observed at one time may not be observed at the next time point, or the identity
  of individual is unavailable. This is in sharp contrast to learning dynamics with
  full trajectory data, on which the majority of existing methods are based. We propose
  a novel method using the weak form of Fokker Planck Equation (FPE) — a partial differential
  equation — to describe the density evolution of data in a sampled form, which is
  then combined with Wasserstein generative adversarial network (WGAN) in the training
  process. In such a sample-based framework we are able to learn the nonlinear dynamics
  from aggregate data without explicitly solving the partial differential equation
  (PDE) FPE. We demonstrate our approach in the context of a series of synthetic and
  real-world data sets.
