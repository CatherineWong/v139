title: Towards Practical Mean Bounds for Small Samples
abstract: Historically, to bound the mean for small sample sizes, practitioners have
  had to choose between using methods with unrealistic assumptions about the unknown
  distribution (e.g., Gaussianity) and methods like Hoeffding’s inequality that use
  weaker assumptions but produce much looser (wider) intervals. In 1969, \citet{Anderson1969}
  proposed a mean confidence interval strictly better than or equal to Hoeffding’s
  whose only assumption is that the distribution’s support is contained in an interval
  $[a,b]$. For the first time since then, we present a new family of bounds that compares
  favorably to Anderson’s. We prove that each bound in the family has {\em guaranteed
  coverage}, i.e., it holds with probability at least $1-\alpha$ for all distributions
  on an interval $[a,b]$. Furthermore, one of the bounds is tighter than or equal
  to Anderson’s for all samples. In simulations, we show that for many distributions,
  the gain over Anderson’s bound is substantial.
