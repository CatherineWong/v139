title: Neural Transformation Learning for Deep Anomaly Detection Beyond Images
abstract: Data transformations (e.g. rotations, reflections, and cropping) play an
  important role in self-supervised learning. Typically, images are transformed into
  different views, and neural networks trained on tasks involving these views produce
  useful feature representations for downstream tasks, including anomaly detection.
  However, for anomaly detection beyond image data, it is often unclear which transformations
  to use. Here we present a simple end-to-end procedure for anomaly detection with
  learnable transformations. The key idea is to embed the transformed data into a
  semantic space such that the transformed data still resemble their untransformed
  form, while different transformations are easily distinguishable. Extensive experiments
  on time series show that our proposed method outperforms existing approaches in
  the one-vs.-rest setting and is competitive in the more challenging n-vs.-rest anomaly-detection
  task. On medical and cyber-security tabular data, our method learns domain-specific
  transformations and detects anomalies more accurately than previous work.
