title: Uncertainty Principles of Encoding GANs
abstract: 'The compelling synthesis results of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
  demonstrate rich semantic knowledge in their latent codes. To obtain this knowledge
  for downstream applications, encoding GANs has been proposed to learn encoders,
  such that real world data can be encoded to latent codes, which can be fed to generators
  to reconstruct those data. However, despite the theoretical guarantees of precise
  reconstruction in previous works, current algorithms generally reconstruct inputs
  with non-negligible deviations from inputs. In this paper we study this predicament
  of encoding GANs, which is indispensable research for the GAN community. We prove
  three uncertainty principles of encoding GANs in practice: a) the ‘perfect’ encoder
  and generator cannot be continuous at the same time, which implies that current
  framework of encoding GANs is ill-posed and needs rethinking; b) neural networks
  cannot approximate the underlying encoder and generator precisely at the same time,
  which explains why we cannot get ‘perfect’ encoders and generators as promised in
  previous theories; c) neural networks cannot be stable and accurate at the same
  time, which demonstrates the difficulty of training and trade-off between fidelity
  and disentanglement encountered in previous works. Our work may eliminate gaps between
  previous theories and empirical results, promote the understanding of GANs, and
  guide network designs for follow-up works.'
