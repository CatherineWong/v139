title: Understanding Failures in Out-of-Distribution Detection with Deep Generative
  Models
abstract: Deep generative models (DGMs) seem a natural fit for detecting out-of-distribution
  (OOD) inputs, but such models have been shown to assign higher probabilities or
  densities to OOD images than images from the training distribution. In this work,
  we explain why this behavior should be attributed to model misestimation. We first
  prove that no method can guarantee performance beyond random chance without assumptions
  on which out-distributions are relevant. We then interrogate the typical set hypothesis,
  the claim that relevant out-distributions can lie in high likelihood regions of
  the data distribution, and that OOD detection should be defined based on the data
  distributionâ€™s typical set. We highlight the consequences implied by assuming support
  overlap between in- and out-distributions, as well as the arbitrariness of the typical
  set for OOD detection. Our results suggest that estimation error is a more plausible
  explanation than the misalignment between likelihood-based OOD detection and out-distributions
  of interest, and we illustrate how even minimal estimation error can lead to OOD
  detection failures, yielding implications for future work in deep generative modeling
  and OOD detection.
