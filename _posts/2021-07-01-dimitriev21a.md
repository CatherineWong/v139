title: 'ARMS: Antithetic-REINFORCE-Multi-Sample Gradient for Binary Variables'
abstract: Estimating the gradients for binary variables is a task that arises frequently
  in various domains, such as training discrete latent variable models. What has been
  commonly used is a REINFORCE based Monte Carlo estimation method that uses either
  independent samples or pairs of negatively correlated samples. To better utilize
  more than two samples, we propose ARMS, an Antithetic REINFORCE-based Multi-Sample
  gradient estimator. ARMS uses a copula to generate any number of mutually antithetic
  samples. It is unbiased, has low variance, and generalizes both DisARM, which we
  show to be ARMS with two samples, and the leave-one-out REINFORCE (LOORF) estimator,
  which is ARMS with uncorrelated samples. We evaluate ARMS on several datasets for
  training generative models, and our experimental results show that it outperforms
  competing methods. We also develop a version of ARMS for optimizing the multi-sample
  variational bound, and show that it outperforms both VIMCO and DisARM. The code
  is publicly available.
