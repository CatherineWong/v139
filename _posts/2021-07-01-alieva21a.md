title: Robust Pure Exploration in Linear Bandits with Limited Budget
abstract: We consider the pure exploration problem in the fixed-budget linear bandit
  setting. We provide a new algorithm that identifies the best arm with high probability
  while being robust to unknown levels of observation noise as well as to moderate
  levels of misspecification in the linear model. Our technique combines prior approaches
  to pure exploration in the multi-armed bandit problem with optimal experimental
  design algorithms to obtain both problem dependent and problem independent bounds.
  Our success probability is never worse than that of an algorithm that ignores the
  linear structure, but seamlessly takes advantage of such structure when possible.
  Furthermore, we only need the number of samples to scale with the dimension of the
  problem rather than the number of arms. We complement our theoretical results with
  empirical validation.
