title: Neighborhood Contrastive Learning Applied to Online Patient Monitoring
abstract: Intensive care units (ICU) are increasingly looking towards machine learning
  for methods to provide online monitoring of critically ill patients. In machine
  learning, online monitoring is often formulated as a supervised learning problem.
  Recently, contrastive learning approaches have demonstrated promising improvements
  over competitive supervised benchmarks. These methods rely on well-understood data
  augmentation techniques developed for image data which do not apply to online monitoring.
  In this work, we overcome this limitation by supplementing time-series data augmentation
  techniques with a novel contrastive learning objective which we call neighborhood
  contrastive learning (NCL). Our objective explicitly groups together contiguous
  time segments from each patient while maintaining state-specific information. Our
  experiments demonstrate a marked improvement over existing work applying contrastive
  methods to medical time-series.
