title: 'Composed Fine-Tuning: Freezing Pre-Trained Denoising Autoencoders for Improved
  Generalization'
abstract: We focus on prediction problems with structured outputs that are subject
  to output validity constraints, e.g. pseudocode-to-code translation where the code
  must compile. While labeled input-output pairs are expensive to obtain, "unlabeled"
  outputs, i.e. outputs without corresponding inputs, are freely available (e.g. code
  on GitHub) and provide information about output validity. Pre-training captures
  this structure by training a denoiser to denoise corrupted versions of unlabeled
  outputs. We first show that standard fine-tuning after pre-training destroys some
  of this structure. We then propose composed fine-tuning, which trains a predictor
  composed with the pre-trained denoiser. Importantly, the denoiser is fixed to preserve
  output structure. Like standard fine-tuning, the predictor is also initialized with
  the pre-trained denoiser. We prove for two-layer ReLU networks that composed fine-tuning
  significantly reduces the complexity of the predictor, thus improving generalization.
  Empirically, we show that composed fine-tuning improves over standard fine-tuning
  on two pseudocode-to-code translation datasets (3% and 6% relative). The improvement
  is magnified on out-of-distribution (OOD) examples (4% and 25% relative), suggesting
  that reducing predictor complexity improves OOD extrapolation.
