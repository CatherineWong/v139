title: 'Causal Curiosity: RL Agents Discovering Self-supervised Experiments for Causal
  Representation Learning'
abstract: Humans show an innate ability to learn the regularities of the world through
  interaction. By performing experiments in our environment, we are able to discern
  the causal factors of variation and infer how they affect the dynamics of our world.
  Analogously, here we attempt to equip reinforcement learning agents with the ability
  to perform experiments that facilitate a categorization of the rolled-out trajectories,
  and to subsequently infer the causal factors of the environment in a hierarchical
  manner. We introduce a novel intrinsic reward, called causal curiosity, and show
  that it allows our agents to learn optimal sequences of actions, and to discover
  causal factors in the dynamics. The learned behavior allows the agent to infer a
  binary quantized representation for the ground-truth causal factors in every environment.
  Additionally, we find that these experimental behaviors are semantically meaningful
  (e.g., to differentiate between heavy and light blocks, our agents learn to lift
  them), and are learnt in a self-supervised manner with approximately 2.5 times less
  data than conventional supervised planners. We show that these behaviors can be
  re-purposed and fine-tuned (e.g., from lifting to pushing or other downstream tasks).
  Finally, we show that the knowledge of causal factor representations aids zero-shot
  learning for more complex tasks.
