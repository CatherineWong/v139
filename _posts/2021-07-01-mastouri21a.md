title: 'Proximal Causal Learning with Kernels: Two-Stage Estimation and Moment Restriction'
abstract: 'We address the problem of causal effect estima-tion in the presence of
  unobserved confounding,but where proxies for the latent confounder(s) areobserved.
  We propose two kernel-based meth-ods for nonlinear causal effect estimation in thissetting:
  (a) a two-stage regression approach, and(b) a maximum moment restriction approach.
  Wefocus on the proximal causal learning setting, butour methods can be used to solve
  a wider classof inverse problems characterised by a Fredholmintegral equation. In
  particular, we provide a uni-fying view of two-stage and moment restrictionapproaches
  for solving this problem in a nonlin-ear setting. We provide consistency guaranteesfor
  each algorithm, and demonstrate that these ap-proaches achieve competitive results
  on syntheticdata and data simulating a real-world task. In par-ticular, our approach
  outperforms earlier methodsthat are not suited to leveraging proxy variables.'
