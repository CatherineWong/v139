title: Signatured Deep Fictitious Play for Mean Field Games with Common Noise
abstract: Existing deep learning methods for solving mean-field games (MFGs) with
  common noise fix the sampling common noise paths and then solve the corresponding
  MFGs. This leads to a nested loop structure with millions of simulations of common
  noise paths in order to produce accurate solutions, which results in prohibitive
  computational cost and limits the applications to a large extent. In this paper,
  based on the rough path theory, we propose a novel single-loop algorithm, named
  signatured deep fictitious play (Sig-DFP), by which we can work with the unfixed
  common noise setup to avoid the nested loop structure and reduce the computational
  complexity significantly. The proposed algorithm can accurately capture the effect
  of common uncertainty changes on mean-field equilibria without further training
  of neural networks, as previously needed in the existing machine learning algorithms.
  The efficiency is supported by three applications, including linear-quadratic MFGs,
  mean-field portfolio game, and mean-field game of optimal consumption and investment.
  Overall, we provide a new point of view from the rough path theory to solve MFGs
  with common noise with significantly improved efficiency and an extensive range
  of applications. In addition, we report the first deep learning work to deal with
  extended MFGs (a mean-field interaction via both the states and controls) with common
  noise.
