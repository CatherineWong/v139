title: Near-Optimal Representation Learning for Linear Bandits and Linear RL
abstract: This paper studies representation learning for multi-task linear bandits
  and multi-task episodic RL with linear value function approximation. We first consider
  the setting where we play $M$ linear bandits with dimension $d$ concurrently, and
  these bandits share a common $k$-dimensional linear representation so that $k\ll
  d$ and $k \ll M$. We propose a sample-efficient algorithm, MTLR-OFUL, which leverages
  the shared representation to achieve $\tilde{O}(M\sqrt{dkT} + d\sqrt{kMT} )$ regret,
  with $T$ being the number of total steps. Our regret significantly improves upon
  the baseline $\tilde{O}(Md\sqrt{T})$ achieved by solving each task independently.
  We further develop a lower bound that shows our regret is near-optimal when $d >
  M$. Furthermore, we extend the algorithm and analysis to multi-task episodic RL
  with linear value function approximation under low inherent Bellman error (Zanette
  et al., 2020a). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical result
  that characterize the benefits of multi-task representation learning for exploration
  in RL with function approximation.
