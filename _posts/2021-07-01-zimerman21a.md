title: Recovering AES Keys with a Deep Cold Boot Attack
abstract: Cold boot attacks inspect the corrupted random access memory soon after
  the power has been shut down. While most of the bits have been corrupted, many bits,
  at random locations, have not. Since the keys in many encryption schemes are being
  expanded in memory into longer keys with fixed redundancies, the keys can often
  be restored. In this work we combine a deep error correcting code technique together
  with a modified SAT solver scheme in order to apply the attack to AES keys. Even
  though AES consists Rijndael SBOX elements, that are specifically designed to be
  resistant to linear and differential cryptanalysis, our method provides a novel
  formalization of the AES key scheduling as a computational graph, which is implemented
  by neural message passing network. Our results show that our methods outperform
  the state of the art attack methods by a very large gap.
