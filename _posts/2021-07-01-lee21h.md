title: Achieving Near Instance-Optimality and Minimax-Optimality in Stochastic and
  Adversarial Linear Bandits Simultaneously
abstract: In this work, we develop linear bandit algorithms that automatically adapt
  to different environments. By plugging a novel loss estimator into the optimization
  problem that characterizes the instance-optimal strategy, our first algorithm not
  only achieves nearly instance-optimal regret in stochastic environments, but also
  works in corrupted environments with additional regret being the amount of corruption,
  while the state-of-the-art (Li et al., 2019) achieves neither instance-optimality
  nor the optimal dependence on the corruption amount. Moreover, by equipping this
  algorithm with an adversarial component and carefully-designed testings, our second
  algorithm additionally enjoys minimax-optimal regret in completely adversarial environments,
  which is the first of this kind to our knowledge. Finally, all our guarantees hold
  with high probability, while existing instance-optimal guarantees only hold in expectation.
