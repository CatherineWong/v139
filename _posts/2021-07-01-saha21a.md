title: Adversarial Dueling Bandits
abstract: 'We introduce the problem of regret minimization in Adversarial Dueling
  Bandits. As in classic Dueling Bandits, the learner has to repeatedly choose a pair
  of items and observe only a relative binary ‘win-loss’ feedback for this pair, but
  here this feedback is generated from an arbitrary preference matrix, possibly chosen
  adversarially. Our main result is an algorithm whose $T$-round regret compared to
  the \emph{Borda-winner} from a set of $K$ items is $\tilde{O}(K^{1/3}T^{2/3})$,
  as well as a matching $\Omega(K^{1/3}T^{2/3})$ lower bound. We also prove a similar
  high probability regret bound. We further consider a simpler \emph{fixed-gap} adversarial
  setup, which bridges between two extreme preference feedback models for dueling
  bandits: stationary preferences and an arbitrary sequence of preferences. For the
  fixed-gap adversarial setup we give an $\smash{ \tilde{O}((K/\Delta^2)\log{T}) }$
  regret algorithm, where $\Delta$ is the gap in Borda scores between the best item
  and all other items, and show a lower bound of $\Omega(K/\Delta^2)$ indicating that
  our dependence on the main problem parameters $K$ and $\Delta$ is tight (up to logarithmic
  factors). Finally, we corroborate the theoretical results with empirical evaluations.'
