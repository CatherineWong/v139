title: Multiscale Invertible Generative Networks for High-Dimensional Bayesian Inference
abstract: We propose a Multiscale Invertible Generative Network (MsIGN) and associated
  training algorithm that leverages multiscale structure to solve high-dimensional
  Bayesian inference. To address the curse of dimensionality, MsIGN exploits the low-dimensional
  nature of the posterior, and generates samples from coarse to fine scale (low to
  high dimension) by iteratively upsampling and refining samples. MsIGN is trained
  in a multi-stage manner to minimize the Jeffreys divergence, which avoids mode dropping
  in high-dimensional cases. On two high-dimensional Bayesian inverse problems, we
  show superior performance of MsIGN over previous approaches in posterior approximation
  and multiple mode capture. On the natural image synthesis task, MsIGN achieves superior
  performance in bits-per-dimension over baseline models and yields great interpret-ability
  of its neurons in intermediate layers.
