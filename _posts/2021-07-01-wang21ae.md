title: Towards Better Laplacian Representation in Reinforcement Learning with Generalized
  Graph Drawing
abstract: The Laplacian representation recently gains increasing attention for reinforcement
  learning as it provides succinct and informative representation for states, by taking
  the eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrix of the state-transition graph as state
  embeddings. Such representation captures the geometry of the underlying state space
  and is beneficial to RL tasks such as option discovery and reward shaping. To approximate
  the Laplacian representation in large (or even continuous) state spaces, recent
  works propose to minimize a spectral graph drawing objective, which however has
  infinitely many global minimizers other than the eigenvectors. As a result, their
  learned Laplacian representation may differ from the ground truth. To solve this
  problem, we reformulate the graph drawing objective into a generalized form and
  derive a new learning objective, which is proved to have eigenvectors as its unique
  global minimizer. It enables learning high-quality Laplacian representations that
  faithfully approximate the ground truth. We validate this via comprehensive experiments
  on a set of gridworld and continuous control environments. Moreover, we show that
  our learned Laplacian representations lead to more exploratory options and better
  reward shaping.
