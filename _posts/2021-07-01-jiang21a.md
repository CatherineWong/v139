title: Self-Damaging Contrastive Learning
abstract: The recent breakthrough achieved by contrastive learning accelerates the
  pace for deploying unsupervised training on real-world data applications. However,
  unlabeled data in reality is commonly imbalanced and shows a long-tail distribution,
  and it is unclear how robustly the latest contrastive learning methods could perform
  in the practical scenario. This paper proposes to explicitly tackle this challenge,
  via a principled framework called Self-Damaging Contrastive Learning (SDCLR), to
  automatically balance the representation learning without knowing the classes. Our
  main inspiration is drawn from the recent finding that deep models have difficult-to-memorize
  samples, and those may be exposed through network pruning. It is further natural
  to hypothesize that long-tail samples are also tougher for the model to learn well
  due to insufficient examples. Hence, the key innovation in SDCLR is to create a
  dynamic self-competitor model to contrast with the target model, which is a pruned
  version of the latter. During training, contrasting the two models will lead to
  adaptive online mining of the most easily forgotten samples for the current target
  model, and implicitly emphasize them more in the contrastive loss. Extensive experiments
  across multiple datasets and imbalance settings show that SDCLR significantly improves
  not only overall accuracies but also balancedness, in terms of linear evaluation
  on the full-shot and few-shot settings. Our code is available at https://github.com/VITA-Group/SDCLR.
