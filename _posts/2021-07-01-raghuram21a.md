title: A General Framework For Detecting Anomalous Inputs to DNN Classifiers
abstract: Detecting anomalous inputs, such as adversarial and out-of-distribution
  (OOD) inputs, is critical for classifiers (including deep neural networks or DNNs)
  deployed in real-world applications. While prior works have proposed various methods
  to detect such anomalous samples using information from the internal layer representations
  of a DNN, there is a lack of consensus on a principled approach for the different
  components of such a detection method. As a result, often heuristic and one-off
  methods are applied for different aspects of this problem. We propose an unsupervised
  anomaly detection framework based on the internal DNN layer representations in the
  form of a meta-algorithm with configurable components. We proceed to propose specific
  instantiations for each component of the meta-algorithm based on ideas grounded
  in statistical testing and anomaly detection. We evaluate the proposed methods on
  well-known image classification datasets with strong adversarial attacks and OOD
  inputs, including an adaptive attack that uses the internal layer representations
  of the DNN (often not considered in prior work). Comparisons with five recently-proposed
  competing detection methods demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in detecting
  adversarial and OOD inputs.
