title: Annealed Flow Transport Monte Carlo
abstract: Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS) and its Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC)
  extensions are state-of-the-art methods for estimating normalizing constants of
  probability distributions. We propose here a novel Monte Carlo algorithm, Annealed
  Flow Transport (AFT), that builds upon AIS and SMC and combines them with normalizing
  flows (NFs) for improved performance. This method transports a set of particles
  using not only importance sampling (IS), Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and resampling
  steps - as in SMC, but also relies on NFs which are learned sequentially to push
  particles towards the successive annealed targets. We provide limit theorems for
  the resulting Monte Carlo estimates of the normalizing constant and expectations
  with respect to the target distribution. Additionally, we show that a continuous-time
  scaling limit of the population version of AFT is given by a Feynmanâ€“Kac measure
  which simplifies to the law of a controlled diffusion for expressive NFs. We demonstrate
  experimentally the benefits and limitations of our methodology on a variety of applications.
