title: Meta-Learning Bidirectional Update Rules
abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new type of generalized neural network where
  neurons and synapses maintain multiple states. We show that classical gradient-based
  backpropagation in neural networks can be seen as a special case of a two-state
  network where one state is used for activations and another for gradients, with
  update rules derived from the chain rule. In our generalized framework, networks
  have neither explicit notion of nor ever receive gradients. The synapses and neurons
  are updated using a bidirectional Hebb-style update rule parameterized by a shared
  low-dimensional "genome". We show that such genomes can be meta-learned from scratch,
  using either conventional optimization techniques, or evolutionary strategies, such
  as CMA-ES. Resulting update rules generalize to unseen tasks and train faster than
  gradient descent based optimizers for several standard computer vision and synthetic
  tasks.
