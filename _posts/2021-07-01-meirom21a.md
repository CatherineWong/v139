title: Controlling Graph Dynamics with Reinforcement Learning and Graph Neural Networks
abstract: 'We consider the problem of controlling a partially-observed dynamic process
  on a graph by a limited number of interventions. This problem naturally arises in
  contexts such as scheduling virus tests to curb an epidemic; targeted marketing
  in order to promote a product; and manually inspecting posts to detect fake news
  spreading on social networks. We formulate this setup as a sequential decision problem
  over a temporal graph process. In face of an exponential state space, combinatorial
  action space and partial observability, we design a novel tractable scheme to control
  dynamical processes on temporal graphs. We successfully apply our approach to two
  popular problems that fall into our framework: prioritizing which nodes should be
  tested in order to curb the spread of an epidemic, and influence maximization on
  a graph.'
