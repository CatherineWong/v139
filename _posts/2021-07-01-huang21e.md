title: A Riemannian Block Coordinate Descent Method for Computing the Projection Robust
  Wasserstein Distance
abstract: The Wasserstein distance has become increasingly important in machine learning
  and deep learning. Despite its popularity, the Wasserstein distance is hard to approximate
  because of the curse of dimensionality. A recently proposed approach to alleviate
  the curse of dimensionality is to project the sampled data from the high dimensional
  probability distribution onto a lower-dimensional subspace, and then compute the
  Wasserstein distance between the projected data. However, this approach requires
  to solve a max-min problem over the Stiefel manifold, which is very challenging
  in practice. In this paper, we propose a Riemannian block coordinate descent (RBCD)
  method to solve this problem, which is based on a novel reformulation of the regularized
  max-min problem over the Stiefel manifold. We show that the complexity of arithmetic
  operations for RBCD to obtain an $\epsilon$-stationary point is $O(\epsilon^{-3})$,
  which is significantly better than the complexity of existing methods. Numerical
  results on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our method is more
  efficient than existing methods, especially when the number of sampled data is very
  large.
