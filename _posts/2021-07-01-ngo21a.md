title: Incentivizing Compliance with Algorithmic Instruments
abstract: Randomized experiments can be susceptible to selection bias due to potential
  non-compliance by the participants. While much of the existing work has studied
  compliance as a static behavior, we propose a game-theoretic model to study compliance
  as dynamic behavior that may change over time. In rounds, a social planner interacts
  with a sequence of heterogeneous agents who arrive with their unobserved private
  type that determines both their prior preferences across the actions (e.g., control
  and treatment) and their baseline rewards without taking any treatment. The planner
  provides each agent with a randomized recommendation that may alter their beliefs
  and their action selection. We develop a novel recommendation mechanism that views
  the planner’s recommendation as a form of instrumental variable (IV) that only affects
  an agents’ action selection, but not the observed rewards. We construct such IVs
  by carefully mapping the history –the interactions between the planner and the previous
  agents– to a random recommendation. Even though the initial agents may be completely
  non-compliant, our mechanism can incentivize compliance over time, thereby enabling
  the estimation of the treatment effect of each treatment, and minimizing the cumulative
  regret of the planner whose goal is to identify the optimal treatment.
