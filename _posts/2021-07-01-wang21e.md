title: 'Accelerate CNNs from Three Dimensions: A Comprehensive Pruning Framework'
abstract: 'Most neural network pruning methods, such as filter-level and layer-level
  prunings, prune the network model along one dimension (depth, width, or resolution)
  solely to meet a computational budget. However, such a pruning policy often leads
  to excessive reduction of that dimension, thus inducing a huge accuracy loss. To
  alleviate this issue, we argue that pruning should be conducted along three dimensions
  comprehensively. For this purpose, our pruning framework formulates pruning as an
  optimization problem. Specifically, it first casts the relationships between a certain
  modelâ€™s accuracy and depth/width/resolution into a polynomial regression and then
  maximizes the polynomial to acquire the optimal values for the three dimensions.
  Finally, the model is pruned along the three optimal dimensions accordingly. In
  this framework, since collecting too much data for training the regression is very
  time-costly, we propose two approaches to lower the cost: 1) specializing the polynomial
  to ensure an accurate regression even with less training data; 2) employing iterative
  pruning and fine-tuning to collect the data faster. Extensive experiments show that
  our proposed algorithm surpasses state-of-the-art pruning algorithms and even neural
  architecture search-based algorithms.'
