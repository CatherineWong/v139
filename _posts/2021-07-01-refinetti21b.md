title: 'Classifying high-dimensional Gaussian mixtures: Where kernel methods fail
  and neural networks succeed'
abstract: A recent series of theoretical works showed that the dynamics of neural
  networks with a certain initialisation are well-captured by kernel methods. Concurrent
  empirical work demonstrated that kernel methods can come close to the performance
  of neural networks on some image classification tasks. These results raise the question
  of whether neural networks only learn successfully if kernels also learn successfully,
  despite being the more expressive function class. Here, we show that two-layer neural
  networks with *only a few neurons* achieve near-optimal performance on high-dimensional
  Gaussian mixture classification while lazy training approaches such as random features
  and kernel methods do not. Our analysis is based on the derivation of a set of ordinary
  differential equations that exactly track the dynamics of the network and thus allow
  to extract the asymptotic performance of the network as a function of regularisation
  or signal-to-noise ratio. We also show how over-parametrising the neural network
  leads to faster convergence, but does not improve its final performance.
