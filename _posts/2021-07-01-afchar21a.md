title: 'Towards Rigorous Interpretations: a Formalisation of Feature Attribution'
abstract: Feature attribution is often loosely presented as the process of selecting
  a subset of relevant features as a rationale of a prediction. Task-dependent by
  nature, precise definitions of "relevance" encountered in the literature are however
  not always consistent. This lack of clarity stems from the fact that we usually
  do not have access to any notion of ground-truth attribution and from a more general
  debate on what good interpretations are. In this paper we propose to formalise feature
  selection/attribution based on the concept of relaxed functional dependence. In
  particular, we extend our notions to the instance-wise setting and derive necessary
  properties for candidate selection solutions, while leaving room for task-dependence.
  By computing ground-truth attributions on synthetic datasets, we evaluate many state-of-the-art
  attribution methods and show that, even when optimised, some fail to verify the
  proposed properties and provide wrong solutions.
