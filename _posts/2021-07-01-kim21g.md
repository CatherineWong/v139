title: A Policy Gradient Algorithm for Learning to Learn in Multiagent Reinforcement
  Learning
abstract: A fundamental challenge in multiagent reinforcement learning is to learn
  beneficial behaviors in a shared environment with other simultaneously learning
  agents. In particular, each agent perceives the environment as effectively non-stationary
  due to the changing policies of other agents. Moreover, each agent is itself constantly
  learning, leading to natural non-stationarity in the distribution of experiences
  encountered. In this paper, we propose a novel meta-multiagent policy gradient theorem
  that directly accounts for the non-stationary policy dynamics inherent to multiagent
  learning settings. This is achieved by modeling our gradient updates to consider
  both an agentâ€™s own non-stationary policy dynamics and the non-stationary policy
  dynamics of other agents in the environment. We show that our theoretically grounded
  approach provides a general solution to the multiagent learning problem, which inherently
  comprises all key aspects of previous state of the art approaches on this topic.
  We test our method on a diverse suite of multiagent benchmarks and demonstrate a
  more efficient ability to adapt to new agents as they learn than baseline methods
  across the full spectrum of mixed incentive, competitive, and cooperative domains.
