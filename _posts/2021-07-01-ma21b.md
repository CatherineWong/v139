title: 'Neural-Pull: Learning Signed Distance Function from Point clouds by Learning
  to Pull Space onto Surface'
abstract: Reconstructing continuous surfaces from 3D point clouds is a fundamental
  operation in 3D geometry processing. Several recent state-of-the-art methods address
  this problem using neural networks to learn signed distance functions (SDFs). In
  this paper, we introduce Neural-Pull, a new approach that is simple and leads to
  high quality SDFs. Specifically, we train a neural network to pull query 3D locations
  to their closest points on the surface using the predicted signed distance values
  and the gradient at the query locations, both of which are computed by the network
  itself. The pulling operation moves each query location with a stride given by the
  distance predicted by the network. Based on the sign of the distance, this may move
  the query location along or against the direction of the gradient of the SDF. This
  is a differentiable operation that allows us to update the signed distance value
  and the gradient simultaneously during training. Our outperforming results under
  widely used benchmarks demonstrate that we can learn SDFs more accurately and flexibly
  for surface reconstruction and single image reconstruction than the state-of-the-art
  methods. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/mabaorui/NeuralPull.
