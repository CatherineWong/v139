title: Adversarial Robustness Guarantees for Random Deep Neural Networks
abstract: The reliability of deep learning algorithms is fundamentally challenged
  by the existence of adversarial examples, which are incorrectly classified inputs
  that are extremely close to a correctly classified input. We explore the properties
  of adversarial examples for deep neural networks with random weights and biases,
  and prove that for any p$\geq$1, the \ell^p distance of any given input from the
  classification boundary scales as one over the square root of the dimension of the
  input times the \ell^p norm of the input. The results are based on the recently
  proved equivalence between Gaussian processes and deep neural networks in the limit
  of infinite width of the hidden layers, and are validated with experiments on both
  random deep neural networks and deep neural networks trained on the MNIST and CIFAR10
  datasets. The results constitute a fundamental advance in the theoretical understanding
  of adversarial examples, and open the way to a thorough theoretical characterization
  of the relation between network architecture and robustness to adversarial perturbations.
