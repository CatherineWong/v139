title: Exact Gap between Generalization Error and Uniform Convergence in Random Feature
  Models
abstract: 'Recent work showed that there could be a large gap between the classical
  uniform convergence bound and the actual test error of zero-training-error predictors
  (interpolators) such as deep neural networks. To better understand this gap, we
  study the uniform convergence in the nonlinear random feature model and perform
  a precise theoretical analysis on how uniform convergence depends on the sample
  size and the number of parameters. We derive and prove analytical expressions for
  three quantities in this model: 1) classical uniform convergence over norm balls,
  2) uniform convergence over interpolators in the norm ball (recently proposed byÂ \citet{zhou2021uniform}),
  and 3) the risk of minimum norm interpolator. We show that, in the setting where
  the classical uniform convergence bound is vacuous (diverges to $\infty$), uniform
  convergence over the interpolators still gives a non-trivial bound of the test error
  of interpolating solutions. We also showcase a different setting where classical
  uniform convergence bound is non-vacuous, but uniform convergence over interpolators
  can give an improved sample complexity guarantee. Our result provides a first exact
  comparison between the test errors and uniform convergence bounds for interpolators
  beyond simple linear models.'
