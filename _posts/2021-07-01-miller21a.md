title: 'Outside the Echo Chamber: Optimizing the Performative Risk'
abstract: In performative prediction, predictions guide decision-making and hence
  can influence the distribution of future data. To date, work on performative prediction
  has focused on finding performatively stable models, which are the fixed points
  of repeated retraining. However, stable solutions can be far from optimal when evaluated
  in terms of the performative risk, the loss experienced by the decision maker when
  deploying a model. In this paper, we shift attention beyond performative stability
  and focus on optimizing the performative risk directly. We identify a natural set
  of properties of the loss function and model-induced distribution shift under which
  the performative risk is convex, a property which does not follow from convexity
  of the loss alone. Furthermore, we develop algorithms that leverage our structural
  assumptions to optimize the performative risk with better sample efficiency than
  generic methods for derivative-free convex optimization.
