title: On Characterizing GAN Convergence Through Proximal Duality Gap
abstract: Despite the accomplishments of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in
  modeling data distributions, training them remains a challenging task. A contributing
  factor to this difficulty is the non-intuitive nature of the GAN loss curves, which
  necessitates a subjective evaluation of the generated output to infer training progress.
  Recently, motivated by game theory, Duality Gap has been proposed as a domain agnostic
  measure to monitor GAN training. However, it is restricted to the setting when the
  GAN converges to a Nash equilibrium. But GANs need not always converge to a Nash
  equilibrium to model the data distribution. In this work, we extend the notion of
  duality gap to proximal duality gap that is applicable to the general context of
  training GANs where Nash equilibria may not exist. We show theoretically that the
  proximal duality gap can monitor the convergence of GANs to a broader spectrum of
  equilibria that subsumes Nash equilibria. We also theoretically establish the relationship
  between the proximal duality gap and the divergence between the real and generated
  data distributions for different GAN formulations. Our results provide new insights
  into the nature of GAN convergence. Finally, we validate experimentally the usefulness
  of proximal duality gap for monitoring and influencing GAN training.
