title: Analyzing the tree-layer structure of Deep Forests
abstract: Random forests on the one hand, and neural networks on the other hand, have
  met great success in the machine learning community for their predictive performance.
  Combinations of both have been proposed in the literature, notably leading to the
  so-called deep forests (DF) (Zhou & Feng,2019). In this paper, our aim is not to
  benchmark DF performances but to investigate instead their underlying mechanisms.
  Additionally, DF architecture can be generally simplified into more simple and computationally
  efficient shallow forest networks. Despite some instability, the latter may outperform
  standard predictive tree-based methods. We exhibit a theoretical framework in which
  a shallow tree network is shown to enhance the performance of classical decision
  trees. In such a setting, we provide tight theoretical lower and upper bounds on
  its excess risk. These theoretical results show the interest of tree-network architectures
  for well-structured data provided that the first layer, acting as a data encoder,
  is rich enough.
