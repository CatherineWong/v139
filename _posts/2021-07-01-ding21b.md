title: 'Dual Principal Component Pursuit for Robust Subspace Learning: Theory and
  Algorithms for a Holistic Approach'
abstract: The Dual Principal Component Pursuit (DPCP) method has been proposed to
  robustly recover a subspace of high-relative dimension from corrupted data. Existing
  analyses and algorithms of DPCP, however, mainly focus on finding a normal to a
  single hyperplane that contains the inliers. Although these algorithms can be extended
  to a subspace of higher co-dimension through a recursive approach that sequentially
  finds a new basis element of the space orthogonal to the subspace, this procedure
  is computationally expensive and lacks convergence guarantees. In this paper, we
  consider a DPCP approach for simultaneously computing the entire basis of the orthogonal
  complement subspace (we call this a holistic approach) by solving a non-convex non-smooth
  optimization problem over the Grassmannian. We provide geometric and statistical
  analyses for the global optimality and prove that it can tolerate as many outliers
  as the square of the number of inliers, under both noiseless and noisy settings.
  We then present a Riemannian regularity condition for the problem, which is then
  used to prove that a Riemannian subgradient method converges linearly to a neighborhood
  of the orthogonal subspace with error proportional to the noise level.
