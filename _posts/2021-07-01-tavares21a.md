title: A Language for Counterfactual Generative Models
abstract: We present Omega, a probabilistic programming language with support for
  counterfactual inference. Counterfactual inference means to observe some fact in
  the present, and infer what would have happened had some past intervention been
  taken, e.g. “given that medication was not effective at dose x, what is the probability
  that it would have been effective at dose 2x?.” We accomplish this by introducing
  a new operator to probabilistic programming akin to Pearl’s do, define its formal
  semantics, provide an implementation, and demonstrate its utility through examples
  in a variety of simulation models.
