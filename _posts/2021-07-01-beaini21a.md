title: Directional Graph Networks
abstract: The lack of anisotropic kernels in graph neural networks (GNNs) strongly
  limits their expressiveness, contributing to well-known issues such as over-smoothing.
  To overcome this limitation, we propose the first globally consistent anisotropic
  kernels for GNNs, allowing for graph convolutions that are defined according to
  topologicaly-derived directional flows. First, by defining a vector field in the
  graph, we develop a method of applying directional derivatives and smoothing by
  projecting node-specific messages into the field. Then, we propose the use of the
  Laplacian eigenvectors as such vector field. We show that the method generalizes
  CNNs on an $n$-dimensional grid and is provably more discriminative than standard
  GNNs regarding the Weisfeiler-Lehman 1-WL test. We evaluate our method on different
  standard benchmarks and see a relative error reduction of 8% on the CIFAR10 graph
  dataset and 11% to 32% on the molecular ZINC dataset, and a relative increase in
  precision of 1.6% on the MolPCBA dataset. An important outcome of this work is that
  it enables graph networks to embed directions in an unsupervised way, thus allowing
  a better representation of the anisotropic features in different physical or biological
  problems.
