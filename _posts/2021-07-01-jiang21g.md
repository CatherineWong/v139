title: The Emergence of Individuality
abstract: Individuality is essential in human society. It induces the division of
  labor and thus improves the efficiency and productivity. Similarly, it should also
  be a key to multi-agent cooperation. Inspired by that individuality is of being
  an individual separate from others, we propose a simple yet efficient method for
  the emergence of individuality (EOI) in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL).
  EOI learns a probabilistic classifier that predicts a probability distribution over
  agents given their observation and gives each agent an intrinsic reward of being
  correctly predicted by the classifier. The intrinsic reward encourages the agents
  to visit their own familiar observations, and learning the classifier by such observations
  makes the intrinsic reward signals stronger and in turn makes the agents more identifiable.
  To further enhance the intrinsic reward and promote the emergence of individuality,
  two regularizers are proposed to increase the discriminability of the classifier.
  We implement EOI on top of popular MARL algorithms. Empirically, we show that EOI
  outperforms existing methods in a variety of multi-agent cooperative scenarios.
