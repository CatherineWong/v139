title: Self Normalizing Flows
abstract: Efficient gradient computation of the Jacobian determinant term is a core
  problem in many machine learning settings, and especially so in the normalizing
  flow framework. Most proposed flow models therefore either restrict to a function
  class with easy evaluation of the Jacobian determinant, or an efficient estimator
  thereof. However, these restrictions limit the performance of such density models,
  frequently requiring significant depth to reach desired performance levels. In this
  work, we propose \emph{Self Normalizing Flows}, a flexible framework for training
  normalizing flows by replacing expensive terms in the gradient by learned approximate
  inverses at each layer. This reduces the computational complexity of each layer’s
  exact update from $\mathcal{O}(D^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(D^2)$, allowing for the training
  of flow architectures which were otherwise computationally infeasible, while also
  providing efficient sampling. We show experimentally that such models are remarkably
  stable and optimize to similar data likelihood values as their exact gradient counterparts,
  while training more quickly and surpassing the performance of functionally constrained
  counterparts.
