title: Discretization Drift in Two-Player Games
abstract: Gradient-based methods for two-player games produce rich dynamics that can
  solve challenging problems, yet can be difficult to stabilize and understand. Part
  of this complexity originates from the discrete update steps given by simultaneous
  or alternating gradient descent, which causes each player to drift away from the
  continuous gradient flow â€“ a phenomenon we call discretization drift. Using backward
  error analysis, we derive modified continuous dynamical systems that closely follow
  the discrete dynamics. These modified dynamics provide an insight into the notorious
  challenges associated with zero-sum games, including Generative Adversarial Networks.
  In particular, we identify distinct components of the discretization drift that
  can alter performance and in some cases destabilize the game. Finally, quantifying
  discretization drift allows us to identify regularizers that explicitly cancel harmful
  forms of drift or strengthen beneficial forms of drift, and thus improve performance
  of GAN training.
