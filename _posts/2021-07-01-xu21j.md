title: 'Doubly Robust Off-Policy Actor-Critic: Convergence and Optimality'
abstract: Designing off-policy reinforcement learning algorithms is typically a very
  challenging task, because a desirable iteration update often involves an expectation
  over an on-policy distribution. Prior off-policy actor-critic (AC) algorithms have
  introduced a new critic that uses the density ratio for adjusting the distribution
  mismatch in order to stabilize the convergence, but at the cost of potentially introducing
  high biases due to the estimation errors of both the density ratio and value function.
  In this paper, we develop a doubly robust off-policy AC (DR-Off-PAC) for discounted
  MDP, which can take advantage of learned nuisance functions to reduce estimation
  errors. Moreover, DR-Off-PAC adopts a single timescale structure, in which both
  actor and critics are updated simultaneously with constant stepsize, and is thus
  more sample efficient than prior algorithms that adopt either two timescale or nested-loop
  structure. We study the finite-time convergence rate and characterize the sample
  complexity for DR-Off-PAC to attain an $\epsilon$-accurate optimal policy. We also
  show that the overall convergence of DR-Off-PAC is doubly robust to the approximation
  errors that depend only on the expressive power of approximation functions. To the
  best of our knowledge, our study establishes the first overall sample complexity
  analysis for single time-scale off-policy AC algorithm.
