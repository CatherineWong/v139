title: PID Accelerated Value Iteration Algorithm
abstract: The convergence rate of Value Iteration (VI), a fundamental procedure in
  dynamic programming and reinforcement learning, for solving MDPs can be slow when
  the discount factor is close to one. We propose modifications to VI in order to
  potentially accelerate its convergence behaviour. The key insight is the realization
  that the evolution of the value function approximations $(V_k)_{k \geq 0}$ in the
  VI procedure can be seen as a dynamical system. This opens up the possibility of
  using techniques from \emph{control theory} to modify, and potentially accelerate,
  this dynamics. We present such modifications based on simple controllers, such as
  PD (Proportional-Derivative), PI (Proportional-Integral), and PID. We present the
  error dynamics of these variants of VI, and provably (for certain classes of MDPs)
  and empirically (for more general classes) show that the convergence rate can be
  significantly improved. We also propose a gain adaptation mechanism in order to
  automatically select the controller gains, and empirically show the effectiveness
  of this procedure.
