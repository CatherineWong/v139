title: End-to-End Learning of Coherent Probabilistic Forecasts for Hierarchical Time
  Series
abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for hierarchical time series forecasting
  that produces coherent, probabilistic forecasts without requiring any explicit post-processing
  reconciliation. Unlike the state-of-the-art, the proposed method simultaneously
  learns from all time series in the hierarchy and incorporates the reconciliation
  step into a single trainable model. This is achieved by applying the reparameterization
  trick and casting reconciliation as an optimization problem with a closed-form solution.
  These model features make end-to-end learning of hierarchical forecasts possible,
  while accomplishing the challenging task of generating forecasts that are both probabilistic
  and coherent. Importantly, our approach also accommodates general aggregation constraints
  including grouped and temporal hierarchies. An extensive empirical evaluation on
  real-world hierarchical datasets demonstrates the advantages of the proposed approach
  over the state-of-the-art.
