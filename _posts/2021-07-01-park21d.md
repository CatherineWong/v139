title: 'Generative Adversarial Networks for Markovian Temporal Dynamics: Stochastic
  Continuous Data Generation'
abstract: In this paper, we present a novel generative adversarial network (GAN) that
  can describe Markovian temporal dynamics. To generate stochastic sequential data,
  we introduce a novel stochastic differential equation-based conditional generator
  and spatial-temporal constrained discriminator networks. To stabilize the learning
  dynamics of the min-max type of the GAN objective function, we propose well-posed
  constraint terms for both networks. We also propose a novel conditional Markov Wasserstein
  distance to induce a pathwise Wasserstein distance. The experimental results demonstrate
  that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods using several different types
  of data.
