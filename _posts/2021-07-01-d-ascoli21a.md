title: 'ConViT: Improving Vision Transformers with Soft Convolutional Inductive Biases'
abstract: 'Convolutional architectures have proven extremely successful for vision
  tasks. Their hard inductive biases enable sample-efficient learning, but come at
  the cost of a potentially lower performance ceiling. Vision Transformers (ViTs)
  rely on more flexible self-attention layers, and have recently outperformed CNNs
  for image classification. However, they require costly pre-training on large external
  datasets or distillation from pre-trained convolutional networks. In this paper,
  we ask the following question: is it possible to combine the strengths of these
  two architectures while avoiding their respective limitations? To this end, we introduce
  gated positional self-attention (GPSA), a form of positional self-attention which
  can be equipped with a “soft" convolutional inductive bias. We initialise the GPSA
  layers to mimic the locality of convolutional layers, then give each attention head
  the freedom to escape locality by adjusting a gating parameter regulating the attention
  paid to position versus content information. The resulting convolutional-like ViT
  architecture, ConViT, outperforms the DeiT on ImageNet, while offering a much improved
  sample efficiency. We further investigate the role of locality in learning by first
  quantifying how it is encouraged in vanilla self-attention layers, then analysing
  how it is escaped in GPSA layers. We conclude by presenting various ablations to
  better understand the success of the ConViT. Our code and models are released publicly
  at https://github.com/facebookresearch/convit.'
