title: 'A theory of high dimensional regression with arbitrary correlations between
  input features and target functions: sample complexity, multiple descent curves
  and a hierarchy of phase transitions'
abstract: 'The performance of neural networks depends on precise relationships between
  four distinct ingredients: the architecture, the loss function, the statistical
  structure of inputs, and the ground truth target function. Much theoretical work
  has focused on understanding the role of the first two ingredients under highly
  simplified models of random uncorrelated data and target functions. In contrast,
  performance likely relies on a conspiracy between the statistical structure of the
  input distribution and the structure of the function to be learned. To understand
  this better we revisit ridge regression in high dimensions, which corresponds to
  an exceedingly simple architecture and loss function, but we analyze its performance
  under arbitrary correlations between input features and the target function. We
  find a rich mathematical structure that includes: (1) a dramatic reduction in sample
  complexity when the target function aligns with data anisotropy; (2) the existence
  of multiple descent curves; (3) a sequence of phase transitions in the performance,
  loss landscape, and optimal regularization as a function of the amount of data that
  explains the first two effects.'
