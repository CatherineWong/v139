title: Model-based Reinforcement Learning for Continuous Control with Posterior Sampling
abstract: 'Balancing exploration and exploitation is crucial in reinforcement learning
  (RL). In this paper, we study model-based posterior sampling for reinforcement learning
  (PSRL) in continuous state-action spaces theoretically and empirically. First, we
  show the first regret bound of PSRL in continuous spaces which is polynomial in
  the episode length to the best of our knowledge. With the assumption that reward
  and transition functions can be modeled by Bayesian linear regression, we develop
  a regret bound of $\tilde{O}(H^{3/2}d\sqrt{T})$, where $H$ is the episode length,
  $d$ is the dimension of the state-action space, and $T$ indicates the total time
  steps. This result matches the best-known regret bound of non-PSRL methods in linear
  MDPs. Our bound can be extended to nonlinear cases as well with feature embedding:
  using linear kernels on the feature representation $\phi$, the regret bound becomes
  $\tilde{O}(H^{3/2}d_{\phi}\sqrt{T})$, where $d_\phi$ is the dimension of the representation
  space. Moreover, we present MPC-PSRL, a model-based posterior sampling algorithm
  with model predictive control for action selection. To capture the uncertainty in
  models, we use Bayesian linear regression on the penultimate layer (the feature
  representation layer $\phi$) of neural networks. Empirical results show that our
  algorithm achieves the state-of-the-art sample efficiency in benchmark continuous
  control tasks compared to prior model-based algorithms, and matches the asymptotic
  performance of model-free algorithms.'
