title: Parallel tempering on optimized paths
abstract: Parallel tempering (PT) is a class of Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms
  that constructs a path of distributions annealing between a tractable reference
  and an intractable target, and then interchanges states along the path to improve
  mixing in the target. The performance of PT depends on how quickly a sample from
  the reference distribution makes its way to the target, which in turn depends on
  the particular path of annealing distributions. However, past work on PT has used
  only simple paths constructed from convex combinations of the reference and target
  log-densities. This paper begins by demonstrating that this path performs poorly
  in the setting where the reference and target are nearly mutually singular. To address
  this issue, we expand the framework of PT to general families of paths, formulate
  the choice of path as an optimization problem that admits tractable gradient estimates,
  and propose a flexible new family of spline interpolation paths for use in practice.
  Theoretical and empirical results both demonstrate that our proposed methodology
  breaks previously-established upper performance limits for traditional paths.
