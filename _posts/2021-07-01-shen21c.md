title: Backdoor Scanning for Deep Neural Networks through K-Arm Optimization
abstract: Back-door attack poses a severe threat to deep learning systems. It injects
  hidden malicious behaviors to a model such that any input stamped with a special
  pattern can trigger such behaviors. Detecting back-door is hence of pressing need.
  Many existing defense techniques use optimization to generate the smallest input
  pattern that forces the model to misclassify a set of benign inputs injected with
  the pattern to a target label. However, the complexity is quadratic to the number
  of class labels such that they can hardly handle models with many classes. Inspired
  by Multi-Arm Bandit in Reinforcement Learning, we propose a K-Arm optimization method
  for backdoor detection. By iteratively and stochastically selecting the most promising
  labels for optimization with the guidance of an objective function, we substantially
  reduce the complexity, allowing to handle models with many classes. Moreover, by
  iteratively refining the selection of labels to optimize, it substantially mitigates
  the uncertainty in choosing the right labels, improving detection accuracy. At the
  time of submission, the evaluation of our method on over 4000 models in the IARPA
  TrojAI competition from round 1 to the latest round 4 achieves top performance on
  the leaderboard. Our technique also supersedes five state-of-the-art techniques
  in terms of accuracy and the scanning time needed. The code of our work is available
