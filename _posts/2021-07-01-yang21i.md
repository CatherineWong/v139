title: Accelerating Safe Reinforcement Learning with Constraint-mismatched Baseline
  Policies
abstract: We consider the problem of reinforcement learning when provided with (1)
  a baseline control policy and (2) a set of constraints that the learner must satisfy.
  The baseline policy can arise from demonstration data or a teacher agent and may
  provide useful cues for learning, but it might also be sub-optimal for the task
  at hand, and is not guaranteed to satisfy the specified constraints, which might
  encode safety, fairness or other application-specific requirements. In order to
  safely learn from baseline policies, we propose an iterative policy optimization
  algorithm that alternates between maximizing expected return on the task, minimizing
  distance to the baseline policy, and projecting the policy onto the constraint-satisfying
  set. We analyze our algorithm theoretically and provide a finite-time convergence
  guarantee. In our experiments on five different control tasks, our algorithm consistently
  outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines, achieving 10 times fewer constraint
  violations and 40% higher reward on average.
