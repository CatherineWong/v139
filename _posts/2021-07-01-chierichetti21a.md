title: Light RUMs
abstract: 'A Random Utility Model (RUM) is a distribution on permutations over a universe
  of items. For each subset of the universe, a RUM induces a natural distribution
  of the winner in the subset: choose a permutation according to the RUM distribution
  and pick the maximum item in the subset according to the chosen permutation. RUMs
  are widely used in the theory of discrete choice. In this paper we consider the
  question of the (lossy) compressibility of RUMs on a universe of size $n$, i.e.,
  the minimum number of bits required to approximate the winning probabilities of
  each slate. Our main result is that RUMs can be approximated using $\tilde{O}(n^2)$
  bits, an exponential improvement over the standard representation; furthermore,
  we show that this bound is optimal. En route, we sharpen the classical existential
  result of McFadden and Train (2000) by showing that the minimum size of a mixture
  of multinomial logits required to can approximate a general RUM is $\tilde{\Theta}(n)$.'
