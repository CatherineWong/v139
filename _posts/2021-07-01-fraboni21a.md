title: 'Clustered Sampling: Low-Variance and Improved Representativity for Clients
  Selection in Federated Learning'
abstract: This work addresses the problem of optimizing communications between server
  and clients in federated learning (FL). Current sampling approaches in FL are either
  biased, or non optimal in terms of server-clients communications and training stability.
  To overcome this issue, we introduce clustered sampling for clients selection. We
  prove that clustered sampling leads to better clients representatitivity and to
  reduced variance of the clients stochastic aggregation weights in FL. Compatibly
  with our theory, we provide two different clustering approaches enabling clients
  aggregation based on 1) sample size, and 2) models similarity. Through a series
  of experiments in non-iid and unbalanced scenarios, we demonstrate that model aggregation
  through clustered sampling consistently leads to better training convergence and
  variability when compared to standard sampling approaches. Our approach does not
  require any additional operation on the clients side, and can be seamlessly integrated
  in standard FL implementations. Finally, clustered sampling is compatible with existing
  methods and technologies for privacy enhancement, and for communication reduction
  through model compression.
