title: Estimating Identifiable Causal Effects on Markov Equivalence Class through
  Double Machine Learning
abstract: General methods have been developed for estimating causal effects from observational
  data under causal assumptions encoded in the form of a causal graph. Most of this
  literature assumes that the underlying causal graph is completely specified. However,
  only observational data is available in most practical settings, which means that
  one can learn at most a Markov equivalence class (MEC) of the underlying causal
  graph. In this paper, we study the problem of causal estimation from a MEC represented
  by a partial ancestral graph (PAG), which is learnable from observational data.
  We develop a general estimator for any identifiable causal effects in a PAG. The
  result fills a gap for an end-to-end solution to causal inference from observational
  data to effects estimation. Specifically, we develop a complete identification algorithm
  that derives an influence function for any identifiable causal effects from PAGs.
  We then construct a double/debiased machine learning (DML) estimator that is robust
  to model misspecification and biases in nuisance function estimation, permitting
  the use of modern machine learning techniques. Simulation results corroborate with
  the theory.
