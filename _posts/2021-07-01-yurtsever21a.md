title: Three Operator Splitting with a Nonconvex Loss Function
abstract: We consider the problem of minimizing the sum of three functions, one of
  which is nonconvex but differentiable, and the other two are convex but possibly
  nondifferentiable. We investigate the Three Operator Splitting method (TOS) of Davis
  & Yin (2017) with an aim to extend its theoretical guarantees for this nonconvex
  problem template. In particular, we prove convergence of TOS with nonasymptotic
  bounds on its nonstationarity and infeasibility errors. In contrast with the existing
  work on nonconvex TOS, our guarantees do not require additional smoothness assumptions
  on the terms comprising the objective; hence they cover instances of particular
  interest where the nondifferentiable terms are indicator functions. We also extend
  our results to a stochastic setting where we have access only to an unbiased estimator
  of the gradient. Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method
  through numerical experiments on quadratic assignment problems.
