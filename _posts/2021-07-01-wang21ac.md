title: Guarantees for Tuning the Step Size using a Learning-to-Learn Approach
abstract: Choosing the right parameters for optimization algorithms is often the key
  to their success in practice. Solving this problem using a learning-to-learn approach—using
  meta-gradient descent on a meta-objective based on the trajectory that the optimizer
  generates—was recently shown to be effective. However, the meta-optimization problem
  is difficult. In particular, the meta-gradient can often explode/vanish, and the
  learned optimizer may not have good generalization performance if the meta-objective
  is not chosen carefully. In this paper we give meta-optimization guarantees for
  the learning-to-learn approach on a simple problem of tuning the step size for quadratic
  loss. Our results show that the naïve objective suffers from meta-gradient explosion/vanishing
  problem. Although there is a way to design the meta-objective so that the meta-gradient
  remains polynomially bounded, computing the meta-gradient directly using backpropagation
  leads to numerical issues. We also characterize when it is necessary to compute
  the meta-objective on a separate validation set to ensure the generalization performance
  of the learned optimizer. Finally, we verify our results empirically and show that
  a similar phenomenon appears even for more complicated learned optimizers parametrized
  by neural networks.
