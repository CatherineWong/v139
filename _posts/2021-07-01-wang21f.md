title: Explainable Automated Graph Representation Learning with Hyperparameter Importance
abstract: Current graph representation (GR) algorithms require huge demand of human
  experts in hyperparameter tuning, which significantly limits their practical applications,
  leading to an urge for automated graph representation without human intervention.
  Although automated machine learning (AutoML) serves as a good candidate for automatic
  hyperparameter tuning, little literature has been reported on automated graph presentation
  learning and the only existing work employs a black-box strategy, lacking insights
  into explaining the relative importance of different hyperparameters. To address
  this issue, we study explainable automated graph representation with hyperparameter
  importance in this paper. We propose an explainable AutoML approach for graph representation
  (e-AutoGR) which utilizes explainable graph features during performance estimation
  and learns decorrelated importance weights for different hyperparameters in affecting
  the model performance through a non-linear decorrelated weighting regression. These
  learned importance weights can in turn help to provide more insights in hyperparameter
  search procedure. We theoretically prove the soundness of the decorrelated weighting
  algorithm. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority
  of our proposed e-AutoGR model against state-of-the-art methods in terms of both
  model performance and hyperparameter importance explainability.
