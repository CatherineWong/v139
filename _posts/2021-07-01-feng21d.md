title: Pointwise Binary Classification with Pairwise Confidence Comparisons
abstract: To alleviate the data requirement for training effective binary classifiers
  in binary classification, many weakly supervised learning settings have been proposed.
  Among them, some consider using pairwise but not pointwise labels, when pointwise
  labels are not accessible due to privacy, confidentiality, or security reasons.
  However, as a pairwise label denotes whether or not two data points share a pointwise
  label, it cannot be easily collected if either point is equally likely to be positive
  or negative. Thus, in this paper, we propose a novel setting called pairwise comparison
  (Pcomp) classification, where we have only pairs of unlabeled data that we know
  one is more likely to be positive than the other. Firstly, we give a Pcomp data
  generation process, derive an unbiased risk estimator (URE) with theoretical guarantee,
  and further improve URE using correction functions. Secondly, we link Pcomp classification
  to noisy-label learning to develop a progressive URE and improve it by imposing
  consistency regularization. Finally, we demonstrate by experiments the effectiveness
  of our methods, which suggests Pcomp is a valuable and practically useful type of
  pairwise supervision besides the pairwise label.
