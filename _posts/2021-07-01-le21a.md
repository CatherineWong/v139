title: 'LAMDA: Label Matching Deep Domain Adaptation'
abstract: Deep domain adaptation (DDA) approaches have recently been shown to perform
  better than their shallow rivals with better modeling capacity on complex domains
  (e.g., image, structural data, and sequential data). The underlying idea is to learn
  domain invariant representations on a latent space that can bridge the gap between
  source and target domains. Several theoretical studies have established insightful
  understanding and the benefit of learning domain invariant features; however, they
  are usually limited to the case where there is no label shift, hence hindering its
  applicability. In this paper, we propose and study a new challenging setting that
  allows us to use a Wasserstein distance (WS) to not only quantify the data shift
  but also to define the label shift directly. We further develop a theory to demonstrate
  that minimizing the WS of the data shift leads to closing the gap between the source
  and target data distributions on the latent space (e.g., an intermediate layer of
  a deep net), while still being able to quantify the label shift with respect to
  this latent space. Interestingly, our theory can consequently explain certain drawbacks
  of learning domain invariant features on the latent space. Finally, grounded on
  the results and guidance of our developed theory, we propose the Label Matching
  Deep Domain Adaptation (LAMDA) approach that outperforms baselines on real-world
  datasets for DA problems.
