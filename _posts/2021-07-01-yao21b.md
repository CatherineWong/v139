title: Improving Generalization in Meta-learning via Task Augmentation
abstract: Meta-learning has proven to be a powerful paradigm for transferring the
  knowledge from previous tasks to facilitate the learning of a novel task. Current
  dominant algorithms train a well-generalized model initialization which is adapted
  to each task via the support set. The crux lies in optimizing the generalization
  capability of the initialization, which is measured by the performance of the adapted
  model on the query set of each task. Unfortunately, this generalization measure,
  evidenced by empirical results, pushes the initialization to overfit the meta-training
  tasks, which significantly impairs the generalization and adaptation to novel tasks.
  To address this issue, we actively augment a meta-training task with “more data”
  when evaluating the generalization. Concretely, we propose two task augmentation
  methods, including MetaMix and Channel Shuffle. MetaMix linearly combines features
  and labels of samples from both the support and query sets. For each class of samples,
  Channel Shuffle randomly replaces a subset of their channels with the corresponding
  ones from a different class. Theoretical studies show how task augmentation improves
  the generalization of meta-learning. Moreover, both MetaMix and Channel Shuffle
  outperform state-of-the-art results by a large margin across many datasets and are
  compatible with existing meta-learning algorithms.
