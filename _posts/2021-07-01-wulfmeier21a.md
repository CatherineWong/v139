title: Data-efficient Hindsight Off-policy Option Learning
abstract: We introduce Hindsight Off-policy Options (HO2), a data-efficient option
  learning algorithm. Given any trajectory, HO2 infers likely option choices and backpropagates
  through the dynamic programming inference procedure to robustly train all policy
  components off-policy and end-to-end. The approach outperforms existing option learning
  methods on common benchmarks. To better understand the option framework and disentangle
  benefits from both temporal and action abstraction, we evaluate ablations with flat
  policies and mixture policies with comparable optimization. The results highlight
  the importance of both types of abstraction as well as off-policy training and trust-region
  constraints, particularly in challenging, simulated 3D robot manipulation tasks
  from raw pixel inputs. Finally, we intuitively adapt the inference step to investigate
  the effect of increased temporal abstraction on training with pre-trained options
  and from scratch.
