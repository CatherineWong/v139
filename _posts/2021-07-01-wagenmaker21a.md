title: Task-Optimal Exploration in Linear Dynamical Systems
abstract: Exploration in unknown environments is a fundamental problem in reinforcement
  learning and control. In this work, we study task-guided exploration and determine
  what precisely an agent must learn about their environment in order to complete
  a particular task. Formally, we study a broad class of decision-making problems
  in the setting of linear dynamical systems, a class that includes the linear quadratic
  regulator problem. We provide instance- and task-dependent lower bounds which explicitly
  quantify the difficulty of completing a task of interest. Motivated by our lower
  bound, we propose a computationally efficient experiment-design based exploration
  algorithm. We show that it optimally explores the environment, collecting precisely
  the information needed to complete the task, and provide finite-time bounds guaranteeing
  that it achieves the instance- and task-optimal sample complexity, up to constant
  factors. Through several examples of the linear quadratic regulator problem, we
  show that performing task-guided exploration provably improves on exploration schemes
  which do not take into account the task of interest. Along the way, we establish
  that certainty equivalence decision making is instance- and task-optimal, and obtain
  the first algorithm for the linear quadratic regulator problem which is instance-optimal.
  We conclude with several experiments illustrating the effectiveness of our approach
  in practice.
