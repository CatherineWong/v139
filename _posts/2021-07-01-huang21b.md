title: A Novel Sequential Coreset Method for Gradient Descent Algorithms
abstract: A wide range of optimization problems arising in machine learning can be
  solved by gradient descent algorithms, and a central question in this area is how
  to efficiently compress a large-scale dataset so as to reduce the computational
  complexity. Coreset is a popular data compression technique that has been extensively
  studied before. However, most of existing coreset methods are problem-dependent
  and cannot be used as a general tool for a broader range of applications. A key
  obstacle is that they often rely on the pseudo-dimension and total sensitivity bound
  that can be very high or hard to obtain. In this paper, based on the “locality”
  property of gradient descent algorithms, we propose a new framework, termed “sequential
  coreset”, which effectively avoids these obstacles. Moreover, our method is particularly
  suitable for sparse optimization whence the coreset size can be further reduced
  to be only poly-logarithmically dependent on the dimension. In practice, the experimental
  results suggest that our method can save a large amount of running time compared
  with the baseline algorithms.
