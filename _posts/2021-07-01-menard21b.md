title: 'UCB Momentum Q-learning: Correcting the bias without forgetting'
abstract: We propose UCBMQ, Upper Confidence Bound Momentum Q-learning, a new algorithm
  for reinforcement learning in tabular and possibly stage-dependent, episodic Markov
  decision process. UCBMQ is based on Q-learning where we add a momentum term and
  rely on the principle of optimism in face of uncertainty to deal with exploration.
  Our new technical ingredient of UCBMQ is the use of momentum to correct the bias
  that Q-learning suffers while, \emph{at the same time}, limiting the impact it has
  on the second-order term of the regret. For UCBMQ, we are able to guarantee a regret
  of at most $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{H^3SAT}+ H^4 S A)$ where $H$ is the length of an episode,
  $S$ the number of states, $A$ the number of actions, $T$ the number of episodes
  and ignoring terms in poly$\log(SAHT)$. Notably, UCBMQ is the first algorithm that
  simultaneously matches the lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{H^3SAT})$ for large enough
  $T$ and has a second-order term (with respect to $T$) that scales \emph{only linearly}
  with the number of states $S$.
