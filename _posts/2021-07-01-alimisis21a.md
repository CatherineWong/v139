title: Communication-Efficient Distributed Optimization with Quantized Preconditioners
abstract: 'We investigate fast and communication-efficient algorithms for the classic
  problem of minimizing a sum of strongly convex and smooth functions that are distributed
  among $n$ different nodes, which can communicate using a limited number of bits.
  Most previous communication-efficient approaches for this problem are limited to
  first-order optimization, and therefore have \emph{linear} dependence on the condition
  number in their communication complexity. We show that this dependence is not inherent:
  communication-efficient methods can in fact have sublinear dependence on the condition
  number. For this, we design and analyze the first communication-efficient distributed
  variants of preconditioned gradient descent for Generalized Linear Models, and for
  Newtonâ€™s method. Our results rely on a new technique for quantizing both the preconditioner
  and the descent direction at each step of the algorithms, while controlling their
  convergence rate. We also validate our findings experimentally, showing faster convergence
  and reduced communication relative to previous methods.'
