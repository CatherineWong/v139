title: Scalable Marginal Likelihood Estimation for Model Selection in Deep Learning
abstract: Marginal-likelihood based model-selection, even though promising, is rarely
  used in deep learning due to estimation difficulties. Instead, most approaches rely
  on validation data, which may not be readily available. In this work, we present
  a scalable marginal-likelihood estimation method to select both hyperparameters
  and network architectures, based on the training data alone. Some hyperparameters
  can be estimated online during training, simplifying the procedure. Our marginal-likelihood
  estimate is based on Laplace’s method and Gauss-Newton approximations to the Hessian,
  and it outperforms cross-validation and manual tuning on standard regression and
  image classification datasets, especially in terms of calibration and out-of-distribution
  detection. Our work shows that marginal likelihoods can improve generalization and
  be useful when validation data is unavailable (e.g., in nonstationary settings).
