title: Asymmetric Heavy Tails and Implicit Bias in Gaussian Noise Injections
abstract: Gaussian noise injections (GNIs) are a family of simple and widely-used
  regularisation methods for training neural networks, where one injects additive
  or multiplicative Gaussian noise to the network activations at every iteration of
  the optimisation algorithm, which is typically chosen as stochastic gradient descent
  (SGD). In this paper, we focus on the so-called ‘implicit effect’ of GNIs, which
  is the effect of the injected noise on the dynamics of SGD. We show that this effect
  induces an \emph{asymmetric heavy-tailed noise} on SGD gradient updates. In order
  to model this modified dynamics, we first develop a Langevin-like stochastic differential
  equation that is driven by a general family of \emph{asymmetric} heavy-tailed noise.
  Using this model we then formally prove that GNIs induce an ‘implicit bias’, which
  varies depending on the heaviness of the tails and the level of asymmetry. Our empirical
  results confirm that different types of neural networks trained with GNIs are well-modelled
  by the proposed dynamics and that the implicit effect of these injections induces
  a bias that degrades the performance of networks.
