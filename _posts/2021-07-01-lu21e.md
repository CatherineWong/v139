title: 'ACE: Explaining cluster from an adversarial perspective'
abstract: A common workflow in single-cell RNA-seq analysis is to project the data
  to a latent space, cluster the cells in that space, and identify sets of marker
  genes that explain the differences among the discovered clusters. A primary drawback
  to this three-step procedure is that each step is carried out independently, thereby
  neglecting the effects of the nonlinear embedding and inter-gene dependencies on
  the selection of marker genes. Here we propose an integrated deep learning framework,
  Adversarial Clustering Explanation (ACE), that bundles all three steps into a single
  workflow. The method thus moves away from the notion of "marker genes" to instead
  identify a panel of explanatory genes. This panel may include genes that are not
  only enriched but also depleted relative to other cell types, as well as genes that
  exhibit differences between closely related cell types. Empirically, we demonstrate
  that ACE is able to identify gene panels that are both highly discriminative and
  nonredundant, and we demonstrate the applicability of ACE to an image recognition
  task.
