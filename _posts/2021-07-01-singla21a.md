title: Skew Orthogonal Convolutions
abstract: 'Training convolutional neural networks with a Lipschitz constraint under
  the $l_{2}$ norm is useful for provable adversarial robustness, interpretable gradients,
  stable training, etc. While 1-Lipschitz networks can be designed by imposing a 1-Lipschitz
  constraint on each layer, training such networks requires each layer to be gradient
  norm preserving (GNP) to prevent gradients from vanishing. However, existing GNP
  convolutions suffer from slow training, lead to significant reduction in accuracy
  and provide no guarantees on their approximations. In this work, we propose a GNP
  convolution layer called \textbf{S}kew \textbf{O}rthogonal \textbf{C}onvolution
  (SOC) that uses the following mathematical property: when a matrix is {\it Skew-Symmetric},
  its exponential function is an {\it orthogonal} matrix. To use this property, we
  first construct a convolution filter whose Jacobian is Skew-Symmetric. Then, we
  use the Taylor series expansion of the Jacobian exponential to construct the SOC
  layer that is orthogonal. To efficiently implement SOC, we keep a finite number
  of terms from the Taylor series and provide a provable guarantee on the approximation
  error. Our experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 show that SOC allows us to train
  provably Lipschitz, large convolutional neural networks significantly faster than
  prior works while achieving significant improvements for both standard and certified
  robust accuracies.'
