title: 'SECANT: Self-Expert Cloning for Zero-Shot Generalization of Visual Policies'
abstract: 'Generalization has been a long-standing challenge for reinforcement learning
  (RL). Visual RL, in particular, can be easily distracted by irrelevant factors in
  high-dimensional observation space. In this work, we consider robust policy learning
  which targets zero-shot generalization to unseen visual environments with large
  distributional shift. We propose SECANT, a novel self-expert cloning technique that
  leverages image augmentation in two stages to *decouple* robust representation learning
  from policy optimization. Specifically, an expert policy is first trained by RL
  from scratch with weak augmentations. A student network then learns to mimic the
  expert policy by supervised learning with strong augmentations, making its representation
  more robust against visual variations compared to the expert. Extensive experiments
  demonstrate that SECANT significantly advances the state of the art in zero-shot
  generalization across 4 challenging domains. Our average reward improvements over
  prior SOTAs are: DeepMind Control (+26.5%), robotic manipulation (+337.8%), vision-based
  autonomous driving (+47.7%), and indoor object navigation (+15.8%). Code release
  and video are available at https://linxifan.github.io/secant-site/.'
