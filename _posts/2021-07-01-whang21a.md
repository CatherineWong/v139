title: Solving Inverse Problems with a Flow-based Noise Model
abstract: We study image inverse problems with a normalizing flow prior. Our formulation
  views the solution as the maximum a posteriori estimate of the image conditioned
  on the measurements. This formulation allows us to use noise models with arbitrary
  dependencies as well as non-linear forward operators. We empirically validate the
  efficacy of our method on various inverse problems, including compressed sensing
  with quantized measurements and denoising with highly structured noise patterns.
  We also present initial theoretical recovery guarantees for solving inverse problems
  with a flow prior.
