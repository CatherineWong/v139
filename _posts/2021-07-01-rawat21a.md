title: Disentangling Sampling and Labeling Bias for Learning in Large-output Spaces
abstract: Negative sampling schemes enable efficient training given a large number
  of classes, by offering a means to approximate a computationally expensive loss
  function that takes all labels into account. In this paper, we present a new connection
  between these schemes and loss modification techniques for countering label imbalance.
  We show that different negative sampling schemes implicitly trade-off performance
  on dominant versus rare labels. Further, we provide a unified means to explicitly
  tackle both sampling bias, arising from working with a subset of all labels, and
  labeling bias, which is inherent to the data due to label imbalance. We empirically
  verify our findings on long-tail classification and retrieval benchmarks.
