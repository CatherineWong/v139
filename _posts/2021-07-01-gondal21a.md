title: Function Contrastive Learning of Transferable Meta-Representations
abstract: Meta-learning algorithms adapt quickly to new tasks that are drawn from
  the same task distribution as the training tasks. The mechanism leading to fast
  adaptation is the conditioning of a downstream predictive model on the inferred
  representation of the task’s underlying data generative process, or \emph{function}.
  This \emph{meta-representation}, which is computed from a few observed examples
  of the underlying function, is learned jointly with the predictive model. In this
  work, we study the implications of this joint training on the transferability of
  the meta-representations. Our goal is to learn meta-representations that are robust
  to noise in the data and facilitate solving a wide range of downstream tasks that
  share the same underlying functions. To this end, we propose a decoupled encoder-decoder
  approach to supervised meta-learning, where the encoder is trained with a contrastive
  objective to find a good representation of the underlying function. In particular,
  our training scheme is driven by the self-supervision signal indicating whether
  two sets of examples stem from the same function. Our experiments on a number of
  synthetic and real-world datasets show that the representations we obtain outperform
  strong baselines in terms of downstream performance and noise robustness, even when
  these baselines are trained in an end-to-end manner.
