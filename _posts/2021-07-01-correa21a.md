title: Fairness and Bias in Online Selection
abstract: There is growing awareness and concern about fairness in machine learning
  and algorithm design. This is particularly true in online selection problems where
  decisions are often biased, for example, when assessing credit risks or hiring staff.
  We address the issues of fairness and bias in online selection by introducing multi-color
  versions of the classic secretary and prophet problem. Interestingly, existing algorithms
  for these problems are either very unfair or very inefficient, so we develop optimal
  fair algorithms for these new problems and provide tight bounds on their competitiveness.
  We validate our theoretical findings on real-world data.
