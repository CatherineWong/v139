title: Collaborative Bayesian Optimization with Fair Regret
abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a popular tool for optimizing complex and
  costly-to-evaluate black-box objective functions. To further reduce the number of
  function evaluations, any party performing BO may be interested to collaborate with
  others to optimize the same objective function concurrently. To do this, existing
  BO algorithms have considered optimizing a batch of input queries in parallel and
  provided theoretical bounds on their cumulative regret reflecting inefficiency.
  However, when the objective function values are correlated with real-world rewards
  (e.g., money), parties may be hesitant to collaborate if they risk incurring larger
  cumulative regret (i.e., smaller real-world reward) than others. This paper shows
  that fairness and efficiency are both necessary for the collaborative BO setting.
  Inspired by social welfare concepts from economics, we propose a new notion of regret
  capturing these properties and a collaborative BO algorithm whose convergence rate
  can be theoretically guaranteed by bounding the new regret, both of which share
  an adjustable parameter for trading off between fairness vs. efficiency. We empirically
  demonstrate the benefits (e.g., increased fairness) of our algorithm using synthetic
  and real-world datasets.
