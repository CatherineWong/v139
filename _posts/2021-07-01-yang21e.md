title: 'BASGD: Buffered Asynchronous SGD for Byzantine Learning'
abstract: Distributed learning has become a hot research topic due to its wide application
  in cluster-based large-scale learning, federated learning, edge computing and so
  on. Most traditional distributed learning methods typically assume no failure or
  attack. However, many unexpected cases, such as communication failure and even malicious
  attack, may happen in real applications. Hence, Byzantine learning (BL), which refers
  to distributed learning with failure or attack, has recently attracted much attention.
  Most existing BL methods are synchronous, which are impractical in some applications
  due to heterogeneous or offline workers. In these cases, asynchronous BL (ABL) is
  usually preferred. In this paper, we propose a novel method, called buffered asynchronous
  stochastic gradient descent (BASGD), for ABL. To the best of our knowledge, BASGD
  is the first ABL method that can resist malicious attack without storing any instances
  on server. Compared with those methods which need to store instances on server,
  BASGD has a wider scope of application. BASGD is proved to be convergent, and be
  able to resist failure or attack. Empirical results show that BASGD significantly
  outperforms vanilla asynchronous stochastic gradient descent (ASGD) and other ABL
  baselines when there exists failure or attack on workers.
