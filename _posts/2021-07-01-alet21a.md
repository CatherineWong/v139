title: A large-scale benchmark for few-shot program induction and synthesis
abstract: A landmark challenge for AI is to learn flexible, powerful representations
  from small numbers of examples. On an important class of tasks, hypotheses in the
  form of programs provide extreme generalization capabilities from surprisingly few
  examples. However, whereas large natural few-shot learning image benchmarks have
  spurred progress in meta-learning for deep networks, there is no comparably big,
  natural program-synthesis dataset that can play a similar role. This is because,
  whereas images are relatively easy to label from internet meta-data or annotated
  by non-experts, generating meaningful input-output examples for program induction
  has proven hard to scale. In this work, we propose a new way of leveraging unit
  tests and natural inputs for small programs as meaningful input-output examples
  for each sub-program of the overall program. This allows us to create a large-scale
  naturalistic few-shot program-induction benchmark and propose new challenges in
  this domain. The evaluation of multiple program induction and synthesis algorithms
  points to shortcomings of current methods and suggests multiple avenues for future
  work.
