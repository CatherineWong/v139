title: Recomposing the Reinforcement Learning Building Blocks with Hypernetworks
abstract: The Reinforcement Learning (RL) building blocks, i.e. $Q$-functions and
  policy networks, usually take elements from the cartesian product of two domains
  as input. In particular, the input of the $Q$-function is both the state and the
  action, and in multi-task problems (Meta-RL) the policy can take a state and a context.
  Standard architectures tend to ignore these variablesâ€™ underlying interpretations
  and simply concatenate their features into a single vector. In this work, we argue
  that this choice may lead to poor gradient estimation in actor-critic algorithms
  and high variance learning steps in Meta-RL algorithms. To consider the interaction
  between the input variables, we suggest using a Hypernetwork architecture where
  a primary network determines the weights of a conditional dynamic network. We show
  that this approach improves the gradient approximation and reduces the learning
  step variance, which both accelerates learning and improves the final performance.
  We demonstrate a consistent improvement across different locomotion tasks and different
  algorithms both in RL (TD3 and SAC) and in Meta-RL (MAML and PEARL).
