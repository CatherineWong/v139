title: Learning from Similarity-Confidence Data
abstract: Weakly supervised learning has drawn considerable attention recently to
  reduce the expensive time and labor consumption of labeling massive data. In this
  paper, we investigate a novel weakly supervised learning problem of learning from
  similarity-confidence (Sconf) data, where only unlabeled data pairs equipped with
  confidence that illustrates their degree of similarity (two examples are similar
  if they belong to the same class) are needed for training a discriminative binary
  classifier. We propose an unbiased estimator of the classification risk that can
  be calculated from only Sconf data and show that the estimation error bound achieves
  the optimal convergence rate. To alleviate potential overfitting when flexible models
  are used, we further employ a risk correction scheme on the proposed risk estimator.
  Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.
