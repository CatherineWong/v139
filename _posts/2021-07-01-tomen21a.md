title: Deep Continuous Networks
abstract: CNNs and computational models of biological vision share some fundamental
  principles, which opened new avenues of research. However, fruitful cross-field
  research is hampered by conventional CNN architectures being based on spatially
  and depthwise discrete representations, which cannot accommodate certain aspects
  of biological complexity such as continuously varying receptive field sizes and
  dynamics of neuronal responses. Here we propose deep continuous networks (DCNs),
  which combine spatially continuous filters, with the continuous depth framework
  of neural ODEs. This allows us to learn the spatial support of the filters during
  training, as well as model the continuous evolution of feature maps, linking DCNs
  closely to biological models. We show that DCNs are versatile and highly applicable
  to standard image classification and reconstruction problems, where they improve
  parameter and data efficiency, and allow for meta-parametrization. We illustrate
  the biological plausibility of the scale distributions learned by DCNs and explore
  their performance in a neuroscientifically inspired pattern completion task. Finally,
  we investigate an efficient implementation of DCNs by changing input contrast.
