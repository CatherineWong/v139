title: Uniform Convergence, Adversarial Spheres and a Simple Remedy
abstract: Previous work has cast doubt on the general framework of uniform convergence
  and its ability to explain generalization in neural networks. By considering a specific
  dataset, it was observed that a neural network completely misclassifies a projection
  of the training data (adversarial set), rendering any existing generalization bound
  based on uniform convergence vacuous. We provide an extensive theoretical investigation
  of the previously studied data setting through the lens of infinitely-wide models.
  We prove that the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) also suffers from the same phenomenon
  and we uncover its origin. We highlight the important role of the output bias and
  show theoretically as well as empirically how a sensible choice completely mitigates
  the problem. We identify sharp phase transitions in the accuracy on the adversarial
  set and study its dependency on the training sample size. As a result, we are able
  to characterize critical sample sizes beyond which the effect disappears. Moreover,
  we study decompositions of a neural network into a clean and noisy part by considering
  its canonical decomposition into its different eigenfunctions and show empirically
  that for too small bias the adversarial phenomenon still persists.
