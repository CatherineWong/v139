title: Improved Confidence Bounds for the Linear Logistic Model and Applications to
  Bandits
abstract: We propose improved fixed-design confidence bounds for the linear logistic
  model. Our bounds significantly improve upon the state-of-the-art bound by Li et
  al. (2017) via recent developments of the self-concordant analysis of the logistic
  loss (Faury et al., 2020). Specifically, our confidence bound avoids a direct dependence
  on $1/\kappa$, where $\kappa$ is the minimal variance over all arms’ reward distributions.
  In general, $1/\kappa$ scales exponentially with the norm of the unknown linear
  parameter $\theta^*$. Instead of relying on this worst case quantity, our confidence
  bound for the reward of any given arm depends directly on the variance of that arm’s
  reward distribution. We present two applications of our novel bounds to pure exploration
  and regret minimization logistic bandits improving upon state-of-the-art performance
  guarantees. For pure exploration we also provide a lower bound highlighting a dependence
  on $1/\kappa$ for a family of instances.
