title: How Framelets Enhance Graph Neural Networks
abstract: 'This paper presents a new approach for assembling graph neural networks
  based on framelet transforms. The latter provides a multi-scale representation for
  graph-structured data. We decompose an input graph into low-pass and high-pass frequencies
  coefficients for network training, which then defines a framelet-based graph convolution.
  The framelet decomposition naturally induces a graph pooling strategy by aggregating
  the graph feature into low-pass and high-pass spectra, which considers both the
  feature values and geometry of the graph data and conserves the total information.
  The graph neural networks with the proposed framelet convolution and pooling achieve
  state-of-the-art performance in many node and graph prediction tasks. Moreover,
  we propose shrinkage as a new activation for the framelet convolution, which thresholds
  high-frequency information at different scales. Compared to ReLU, shrinkage activation
  improves model performance on denoising and signal compression: noises in both node
  and structure can be significantly reduced by accurately cutting off the high-pass
  coefficients from framelet decomposition, and the signal can be compressed to less
  than half its original size with well-preserved prediction performance.'
