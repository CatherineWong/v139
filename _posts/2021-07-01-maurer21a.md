title: Robust Unsupervised Learning via L-statistic Minimization
abstract: Designing learning algorithms that are resistant to perturbations of the
  underlying data distribution is a problem of wide practical and theoretical importance.
  We present a general approach to this problem focusing on unsupervised learning.
  The key assumption is that the perturbing distribution is characterized by larger
  losses relative to a given class of admissible models. This is exploited by a general
  descent algorithm which minimizes an $L$-statistic criterion over the model class,
  weighting small losses more. Our analysis characterizes the robustness of the method
  in terms of bounds on the reconstruction error relative to the underlying unperturbed
  distribution. As a byproduct, we prove uniform convergence bounds with respect to
  the proposed criterion for several popular models in unsupervised learning, a result
  which may be of independent interest. Numerical experiments with \textsc{kmeans}
  clustering and principal subspace analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of our
  approach.
