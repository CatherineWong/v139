title: 'UniSpeech: Unified Speech Representation Learning with Labeled and Unlabeled
  Data'
abstract: In this paper, we propose a unified pre-training approach called UniSpeech
  to learn speech representations with both labeled and unlabeled data, in which supervised
  phonetic CTC learning and phonetically-aware contrastive self-supervised learning
  are conducted in a multi-task learning manner. The resultant representations can
  capture information more correlated with phonetic structures and improve the generalization
  across languages and domains. We evaluate the effectiveness of UniSpeech for cross-lingual
  representation learning on public CommonVoice corpus. The results show that UniSpeech
  outperforms self-supervised pretraining and supervised transfer learning for speech
  recognition by a maximum of 13.4% and 26.9% relative phone error rate reductions
  respectively (averaged over all testing languages). The transferability of UniSpeech
  is also verified on a domain-shift speech recognition task, i.e., a relative word
  error rate reduction of 6% against the previous approach.
