title: Distributed Second Order Methods with Fast Rates and Compressed Communication
abstract: We develop several new communication-efficient second-order methods for
  distributed optimization. Our first method, NEWTON-STAR, is a variant of Newton’s
  method from which it inherits its fast local quadratic rate. However, unlike Newton’s
  method, NEWTON-STAR enjoys the same per iteration communication cost as gradient
  descent. While this method is impractical as it relies on the use of certain unknown
  parameters characterizing the Hessian of the objective function at the optimum,
  it serves as the starting point which enables us to design practical variants thereof
  with strong theoretical guarantees. In particular, we design a stochastic sparsification
  strategy for learning the unknown parameters in an iterative fashion in a communication
  efficient manner. Applying this strategy to NEWTON-STAR leads to our next method,
  NEWTON-LEARN, for which we prove local linear and superlinear rates independent
  of the condition number. When applicable, this method can have dramatically superior
  convergence behavior when compared to state-of-the-art methods. Finally, we develop
  a globalization strategy using cubic regularization which leads to our next method,
  CUBIC-NEWTON-LEARN, for which we prove global sublinear and linear convergence rates,
  and a fast superlinear rate. Our results are supported with experimental results
  on real datasets, and show several orders of magnitude improvement on baseline and
  state-of-the-art methods in terms of communication complexity.
