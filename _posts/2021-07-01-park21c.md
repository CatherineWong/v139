title: Conditional Distributional Treatment Effect with Kernel Conditional Mean Embeddings
  and U-Statistic Regression
abstract: We propose to analyse the conditional distributional treatment effect (CoDiTE),
  which, in contrast to the more common conditional average treatment effect (CATE),
  is designed to encode a treatment’s distributional aspects beyond the mean. We first
  introduce a formal definition of the CoDiTE associated with a distance function
  between probability measures. Then we discuss the CoDiTE associated with the maximum
  mean discrepancy via kernel conditional mean embeddings, which, coupled with a hypothesis
  test, tells us whether there is any conditional distributional effect of the treatment.
  Finally, we investigate what kind of conditional distributional effect the treatment
  has, both in an exploratory manner via the conditional witness function, and in
  a quantitative manner via U-statistic regression, generalising the CATE to higher-order
  moments. Experiments on synthetic, semi-synthetic and real datasets demonstrate
  the merits of our approach.
