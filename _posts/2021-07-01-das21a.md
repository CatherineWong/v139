title: 'SAINT-ACC: Safety-Aware Intelligent Adaptive Cruise Control for Autonomous
  Vehicles Using Deep Reinforcement Learning'
abstract: 'We present a novel adaptive cruise control (ACC) system namely SAINT-ACC:
  {S}afety-{A}ware {Int}elligent {ACC} system (SAINT-ACC) that is designed to achieve
  simultaneous optimization of traffic efficiency, driving safety, and driving comfort
  through dynamic adaptation of the inter-vehicle gap based on deep reinforcement
  learning (RL). A novel dual RL agent-based approach is developed to seek and adapt
  the optimal balance between traffic efficiency and driving safety/comfort by effectively
  controlling the driving safety model parameters and inter-vehicle gap based on macroscopic
  and microscopic traffic information collected from dynamically changing and complex
  traffic environments. Results obtained through over 12,000 simulation runs with
  varying traffic scenarios and penetration rates demonstrate that SAINT-ACC significantly
  enhances traffic flow, driving safety and comfort compared with a state-of-the-art
  approach.'
