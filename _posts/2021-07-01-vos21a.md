title: Efficient Training of Robust Decision Trees Against Adversarial Examples
abstract: Current state-of-the-art algorithms for training robust decision trees have
  high runtime costs and require hours to run. We present GROOT, an efficient algorithm
  for training robust decision trees and random forests that runs in a matter of seconds
  to minutes. Where before the worst-case Gini impurity was computed iteratively,
  we find that we can solve this function analytically to improve time complexity
  from O(n) to O(1) in terms of n samples. Our results on both single trees and ensembles
  on 14 structured datasets as well as on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST demonstrate that
  GROOT runs several orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art works and
  also shows better performance in terms of adversarial accuracy on structured data.
