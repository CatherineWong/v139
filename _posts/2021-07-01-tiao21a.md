title: 'BORE: Bayesian Optimization by Density-Ratio Estimation'
abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is among the most effective and widely-used blackbox
  optimization methods. BO proposes solutions according to an explore-exploit trade-off
  criterion encoded in an acquisition function, many of which are computed from the
  posterior predictive of a probabilistic surrogate model. Prevalent among these is
  the expected improvement (EI). The need to ensure analytical tractability of the
  predictive often poses limitations that can hinder the efficiency and applicability
  of BO. In this paper, we cast the computation of EI as a binary classification problem,
  building on the link between class-probability estimation and density-ratio estimation,
  and the lesser-known link between density-ratios and EI. By circumventing the tractability
  constraints, this reformulation provides numerous advantages, not least in terms
  of expressiveness, versatility, and scalability.
