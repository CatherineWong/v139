title: Affine Invariant Analysis of Frank-Wolfe on Strongly Convex Sets
abstract: It is known that the Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm, which is affine covariant,
  enjoys faster convergence rates than $\mathcal{O}\left(1/K\right)$ when the constraint
  set is strongly convex. However, these results rely on norm-dependent assumptions,
  usually incurring non-affine invariant bounds, in contradiction with FW’s affine
  covariant property. In this work, we introduce new structural assumptions on the
  problem (such as the directional smoothness) and derive an affine invariant, norm-independent
  analysis of Frank-Wolfe. We show that our rates are better than any other known
  convergence rates of FW in this setting. Based on our analysis, we propose an affine
  invariant backtracking line-search. Interestingly, we show that typical backtracking
  line-searches using smoothness of the objective function present similar performances
  than its affine invariant counterpart, despite using affine dependent norms in the
  step size’s computation.
