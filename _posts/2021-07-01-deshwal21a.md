title: Bayesian Optimization over Hybrid Spaces
abstract: We consider the problem of optimizing hybrid structures (mixture of discrete
  and continuous input variables) via expensive black-box function evaluations. This
  problem arises in many real-world applications. For example, in materials design
  optimization via lab experiments, discrete and continuous variables correspond to
  the presence/absence of primitive elements and their relative concentrations respectively.
  The key challenge is to accurately model the complex interactions between discrete
  and continuous variables. In this paper, we propose a novel approach referred as
  Hybrid Bayesian Optimization (HyBO) by utilizing diffusion kernels, which are naturally
  defined over continuous and discrete variables. We develop a principled approach
  for constructing diffusion kernels over hybrid spaces by utilizing the additive
  kernel formulation, which allows additive interactions of all orders in a tractable
  manner. We theoretically analyze the modeling strength of additive hybrid kernels
  and prove that it has the universal approximation property. Our experiments on synthetic
  and six diverse real-world benchmarks show that HyBO significantly outperforms the
  state-of-the-art methods.
