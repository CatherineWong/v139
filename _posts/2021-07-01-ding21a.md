title: 'XOR-CD: Linearly Convergent Constrained Structure Generation'
abstract: We propose XOR-Contrastive Divergence learning (XOR-CD), a provable approach
  for constrained structure generation, which remains difficult for state-of-the-art
  neural network and constraint reasoning approaches. XOR-CD harnesses XOR-Sampling
  to generate samples from the model distribution in CD learning and is guaranteed
  to generate valid structures. In addition, XOR-CD has a linear convergence rate
  towards the global maximum of the likelihood function within a vanishing constant
  in learning exponential family models. Constraint satisfaction enabled by XOR-CD
  also boosts its learning performance. Our real-world experiments on data-driven
  experimental design, dispatching route generation, and sequence-based protein homology
  detection demonstrate the superior performance of XOR-CD compared to baseline approaches
  in generating valid structures as well as capturing the inductive bias in the training
  set.
