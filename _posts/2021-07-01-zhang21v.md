title: Matrix Sketching for Secure Collaborative Machine Learning
abstract: Collaborative learning allows participants to jointly train a model without
  data sharing. To update the model parameters, the central server broadcasts model
  parameters to the clients, and the clients send updating directions such as gradients
  to the server. While data do not leave a client device, the communicated gradients
  and parameters will leak a client’s privacy. Attacks that infer clients’ privacy
  from gradients and parameters have been developed by prior work. Simple defenses
  such as dropout and differential privacy either fail to defend the attacks or seriously
  hurt test accuracy. We propose a practical defense which we call Double-Blind Collaborative
  Learning (DBCL). The high-level idea is to apply random matrix sketching to the
  parameters (aka weights) and re-generate random sketching after each iteration.
  DBCL prevents clients from conducting gradient-based privacy inferences which are
  the most effective attacks. DBCL works because from the attacker’s perspective,
  sketching is effectively random noise that outweighs the signal. Notably, DBCL does
  not much increase computation and communication costs and does not hurt test accuracy
  at all.
