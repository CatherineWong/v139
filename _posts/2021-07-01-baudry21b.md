title: On Limited-Memory Subsampling Strategies for Bandits
abstract: There has been a recent surge of interest in non-parametric bandit algorithms
  based on subsampling. One drawback however of these approaches is the additional
  complexity required by random subsampling and the storage of the full history of
  rewards. Our first contribution is to show that a simple deterministic subsampling
  rule, proposed in the recent work of \citet{baudry2020sub} under the name of “last-block
  subsampling”, is asymptotically optimal in one-parameter exponential families. In
  addition, we prove that these guarantees also hold when limiting the algorithm memory
  to a polylogarithmic function of the time horizon. These findings open up new perspectives,
  in particular for non-stationary scenarios in which the arm distributions evolve
  over time. We propose a variant of the algorithm in which only the most recent observations
  are used for subsampling, achieving optimal regret guarantees under the assumption
  of a known number of abrupt changes. Extensive numerical simulations highlight the
  merits of this approach, particularly when the changes are not only affecting the
  means of the rewards.
