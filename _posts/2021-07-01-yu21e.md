title: Learning Generalized Intersection Over Union for Dense Pixelwise Prediction
abstract: Intersection over union (IoU) score, also named Jaccard Index, is one of
  the most fundamental evaluation methods in machine learning. The original IoU computation
  cannot provide non-zero gradients and thus cannot be directly optimized by nowadays
  deep learning methods. Several recent works generalized IoU for bounding box regression,
  but they are not straightforward to adapt for pixelwise prediction. In particular,
  the original IoU fails to provide effective gradients for the non-overlapping and
  location-deviation cases, which results in performance plateau. In this paper, we
  propose PixIoU, a generalized IoU for pixelwise prediction that is sensitive to
  the distance for non-overlapping cases and the locations in prediction. We provide
  proofs that PixIoU holds many nice properties as the original IoU. To optimize the
  PixIoU, we also propose a loss function that is proved to be submodular, hence we
  can apply the Lov√°sz functions, the efficient surrogates for submodular functions
  for learning this loss. Experimental results show consistent performance improvements
  by learning PixIoU over the original IoU for several different pixelwise prediction
  tasks on Pascal VOC, VOT-2020 and Cityscapes.
