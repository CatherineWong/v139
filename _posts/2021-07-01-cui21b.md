title: Randomized Algorithms for Submodular Function Maximization with a $k$-System
  Constraint
abstract: Submodular optimization has numerous applications such as crowdsourcing
  and viral marketing. In this paper, we study the problem of non-negative submodular
  function maximization subject to a $k$-system constraint, which generalizes many
  other important constraints in submodular optimization such as cardinality constraint,
  matroid constraint, and $k$-extendible system constraint. The existing approaches
  for this problem are all based on deterministic algorithmic frameworks, and the
  best approximation ratio achieved by these algorithms (for a general submodular
  function) is $k+2\sqrt{k+2}+3$. We propose a randomized algorithm with an improved
  approximation ratio of $(1+\sqrt{k})^2$, while achieving nearly-linear time complexity
  significantly lower than that of the state-of-the-art algorithm. We also show that
  our algorithm can be further generalized to address a stochastic case where the
  elements can be adaptively selected, and propose an approximation ratio of $(1+\sqrt{k+1})^2$
  for the adaptive optimization case. The empirical performance of our algorithms
  is extensively evaluated in several applications related to data mining and social
  computing, and the experimental results demonstrate the superiorities of our algorithms
  in terms of both utility and efficiency.
