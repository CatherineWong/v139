title: Label Distribution Learning Machine
abstract: Although Label Distribution Learning (LDL) has witnessed extensive classification
  applications, it faces the challenge of objective mismatch â€“ the objective of LDL
  mismatches that of classification, which has seldom been noticed in existing studies.
  Our goal is to solve the objective mismatch and improve the classification performance
  of LDL. Specifically, we extend the margin theory to LDL and propose a new LDL method
  called \textbf{L}abel \textbf{D}istribution \textbf{L}earning \textbf{M}achine (LDLM).
  First, we define the label distribution margin and propose the \textbf{S}upport
  \textbf{V}ector \textbf{R}egression \textbf{M}achine (SVRM) to learn the optimal
  label. Second, we propose the adaptive margin loss to learn label description degrees.
  In theoretical analysis, we develop a generalization theory for the SVRM and analyze
  the generalization of LDLM. Experimental results validate the better classification
  performance of LDLM.
