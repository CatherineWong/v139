title: 'ProGraML: A Graph-based Program Representation for Data Flow Analysis and
  Compiler Optimizations'
abstract: Machine learning (ML) is increasingly seen as a viable approach for building
  compiler optimization heuristics, but many ML methods cannot replicate even the
  simplest of the data flow analyses that are critical to making good optimization
  decisions. We posit that if ML cannot do that, then it is insufficiently able to
  reason about programs. We formulate data flow analyses as supervised learning tasks
  and introduce a large open dataset of programs and their corresponding labels from
  several analyses. We use this dataset to benchmark ML methods and show that they
  struggle on these fundamental program reasoning tasks. We propose ProGraML - Program
  Graphs for Machine Learning - a language-independent, portable representation of
  program semantics. ProGraML overcomes the limitations of prior works and yields
  improved performance on downstream optimization tasks.
