title: Finite mixture models do not reliably learn the number of components
abstract: 'Scientists and engineers are often interested in learning the number of
  subpopulations (or components) present in a data set. A common suggestion is to
  use a finite mixture model (FMM) with a prior on the number of components. Past
  work has shown the resulting FMM component-count posterior is consistent; that is,
  the posterior concentrates on the true, generating number of components. But consistency
  requires the assumption that the component likelihoods are perfectly specified,
  which is unrealistic in practice. In this paper, we add rigor to data-analysis folk
  wisdom by proving that under even the slightest model misspecification, the FMM
  component-count posterior diverges: the posterior probability of any particular
  finite number of components converges to 0 in the limit of infinite data. Contrary
  to intuition, posterior-density consistency is not sufficient to establish this
  result. We develop novel sufficient conditions that are more realistic and easily
  checkable than those common in the asymptotics literature. We illustrate practical
  consequences of our theory on simulated and real data.'
