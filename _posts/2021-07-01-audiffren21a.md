title: Dichotomous Optimistic Search to Quantify Human Perception
abstract: In this paper we address a variant of the continuous multi-armed bandits
  problem, called the threshold estimation problem, which is at the heart of many
  psychometric experiments. Here, the objective is to estimate the sensitivity threshold
  for an unknown psychometric function Psi, which is assumed to be non decreasing
  and continuous. Our algorithm, Dichotomous Optimistic Search (DOS), efficiently
  solves this task by taking inspiration from hierarchical multi-armed bandits and
  Black-box optimization. Compared to previous approaches, DOS is model free and only
  makes minimal assumption on Psi smoothness, while having strong theoretical guarantees
  that compares favorably to recent methods from both Psychophysics and Global Optimization.
  We also empirically evaluate DOS and show that it significantly outperforms these
  methods, both in experiments that mimics the conduct of a psychometric experiment,
  and in tests with large pulls budgets that illustrate the faster convergence rate.
