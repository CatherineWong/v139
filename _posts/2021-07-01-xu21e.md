title: 'Dash: Semi-Supervised Learning with Dynamic Thresholding'
abstract: While semi-supervised learning (SSL) has received tremendous attentions
  in many machine learning tasks due to its successful use of unlabeled data, existing
  SSL algorithms use either all unlabeled examples or the unlabeled examples with
  a fixed high-confidence prediction during the training progress. However, it is
  possible that too many correct/wrong pseudo labeled examples are eliminated/selected.
  In this work we develop a simple yet powerful framework, whose key idea is to select
  a subset of training examples from the unlabeled data when performing existing SSL
  methods so that only the unlabeled examples with pseudo labels related to the labeled
  data will be used to train models. The selection is performed at each updating iteration
  by only keeping the examples whose losses are smaller than a given threshold that
  is dynamically adjusted through the iteration. Our proposed approach, Dash, enjoys
  its adaptivity in terms of unlabeled data selection and its theoretical guarantee.
  Specifically, we theoretically establish the convergence rate of Dash from the view
  of non-convex optimization. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness
  of the proposed method in comparison with state-of-the-art over benchmarks.
