title: Query Complexity of Adversarial Attacks
abstract: 'There are two main attack models considered in the adversarial robustness
  literature: black-box and white-box. We consider these threat models as two ends
  of a fine-grained spectrum, indexed by the number of queries the adversary can ask.
  Using this point of view we investigate how many queries the adversary needs to
  make to design an attack that is comparable to the best possible attack in the white-box
  model. We give a lower bound on that number of queries in terms of entropy of decision
  boundaries of the classifier. Using this result we analyze two classical learning
  algorithms on two synthetic tasks for which we prove meaningful security guarantees.
  The obtained bounds suggest that some learning algorithms are inherently more robust
  against query-bounded adversaries than others.'
