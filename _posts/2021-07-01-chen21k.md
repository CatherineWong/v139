title: 'CARTL: Cooperative Adversarially-Robust Transfer Learning'
abstract: Transfer learning eases the burden of training a well-performed model from
  scratch, especially when training data is scarce and computation power is limited.
  In deep learning, a typical strategy for transfer learning is to freeze the early
  layers of a pre-trained model and fine-tune the rest of its layers on the target
  domain. Previous work focuses on the accuracy of the transferred model but neglects
  the transfer of adversarial robustness. In this work, we first show that transfer
  learning improves the accuracy on the target domain but degrades the inherited robustness
  of the target model. To address such a problem, we propose a novel cooperative adversarially-robust
  transfer learning (CARTL) by pre-training the model via feature distance minimization
  and fine-tuning the pre-trained model with non-expansive fine-tuning for target
  domain tasks. Empirical results show that CARTL improves the inherited robustness
  by about 28% at most compared with the baseline with the same degree of accuracy.
  Furthermore, we study the relationship between the batch normalization (BN) layers
  and the robustness in the context of transfer learning, and we reveal that freezing
  BN layers can further boost the robustness transfer.
