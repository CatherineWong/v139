title: Representational aspects of depth and conditioning in normalizing flows
abstract: 'Normalizing flows are among the most popular paradigms in generative modeling,
  especially for images, primarily because we can efficiently evaluate the likelihood
  of a data point. This is desirable both for evaluating the fit of a model, and for
  ease of training, as maximizing the likelihood can be done by gradient descent.
  However, training normalizing flows comes with difficulties as well: models which
  produce good samples typically need to be extremely deep â€“ which comes with accompanying
  vanishing/exploding gradient problems. A very related problem is that they are often
  poorly \emph{conditioned}: since they are parametrized as invertible maps from $\mathbb{R}^d
  \to \mathbb{R}^d$, and typical training data like images intuitively is lower-dimensional,
  the learned maps often have Jacobians that are close to being singular. In our paper,
  we tackle representational aspects around depth and conditioning of normalizing
  flows: both for general invertible architectures, and for a particular common architecture,
  affine couplings. We prove that $\Theta(1)$ affine coupling layers suffice to exactly
  represent a permutation or $1 \times 1$ convolution, as used in GLOW, showing that
  representationally the choice of partition is not a bottleneck for depth. We also
  show that shallow affine coupling networks are universal approximators in Wasserstein
  distance if ill-conditioning is allowed, and experimentally investigate related
  phenomena involving padding. Finally, we show a depth lower bound for general flow
  architectures with few neurons per layer and bounded Lipschitz constant.'
