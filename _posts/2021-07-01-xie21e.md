title: Interaction-Grounded Learning
abstract: Consider a prosthetic arm, learning to adapt to its user’s control signals.
  We propose \emph{Interaction-Grounded Learning} for this novel setting, in which
  a learner’s goal is to interact with the environment with no grounding or explicit
  reward to optimize its policies. Such a problem evades common RL solutions which
  require an explicit reward. The learning agent observes a multidimensional \emph{context
  vector}, takes an \emph{action}, and then observes a multidimensional \emph{feedback
  vector}. This multidimensional feedback vector has \emph{no} explicit reward information.
  In order to succeed, the algorithm must learn how to evaluate the feedback vector
  to discover a latent reward signal, with which it can ground its policies without
  supervision. We show that in an Interaction-Grounded Learning setting, with certain
  natural assumptions, a learner can discover the latent reward and ground its policy
  for successful interaction. We provide theoretical guarantees and a proof-of-concept
  empirical evaluation to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.
