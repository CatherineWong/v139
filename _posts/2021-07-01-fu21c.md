title: 'Double-Win Quant: Aggressively Winning Robustness of Quantized Deep Neural
  Networks via Random Precision Training and Inference'
abstract: 'Quantization is promising in enabling powerful yet complex deep neural
  networks (DNNs) to be deployed into resource constrained platforms. However, quantized
  DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks unless being equipped with sophisticated
  techniques, leading to a dilemma of struggling between DNNs’ efficiency and robustness.
  In this work, we demonstrate a new perspective regarding quantization’s role in
  DNNs’ robustness, advocating that quantization can be leveraged to largely boost
  DNNs’ robustness, and propose a framework dubbed Double-Win Quant that can boost
  the robustness of quantized DNNs over their full precision counterparts by a large
  margin. Specifically, we for the first time identify that when an adversarially
  trained model is quantized to different precisions in a post-training manner, the
  associated adversarial attacks transfer poorly between different precisions. Leveraging
  this intriguing observation, we further develop Double-Win Quant integrating random
  precision inference and training to further reduce and utilize the poor adversarial
  transferability, enabling an aggressive “win-win" in terms of DNNs’ robustness and
  efficiency. Extensive experiments and ablation studies consistently validate Double-Win
  Quant’s effectiveness and advantages over state-of-the-art (SOTA) adversarial training
  methods across various attacks/models/datasets. Our codes are available at: https://github.com/RICE-EIC/Double-Win-Quant.'
