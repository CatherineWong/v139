title: Offline Reinforcement Learning with Fisher Divergence Critic Regularization
abstract: Many modern approaches to offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) utilize behavior
  regularization, typically augmenting a model-free actor critic algorithm with a
  penalty measuring divergence of the policy from the offline data. In this work,
  we propose an alternative approach to encouraging the learned policy to stay close
  to the data, namely parameterizing the critic as the log-behavior-policy, which
  generated the offline data, plus a state-action value offset term, which can be
  learned using a neural network. Behavior regularization then corresponds to an appropriate
  regularizer on the offset term. We propose using a gradient penalty regularizer
  for the offset term and demonstrate its equivalence to Fisher divergence regularization,
  suggesting connections to the score matching and generative energy-based model literature.
  We thus term our resulting algorithm Fisher-BRC (Behavior Regularized Critic). On
  standard offline RL benchmarks, Fisher-BRC achieves both improved performance and
  faster convergence over existing state-of-the-art methods.
