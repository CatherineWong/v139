title: 'SGA: A Robust Algorithm for Partial Recovery of Tree-Structured Graphical
  Models with Noisy Samples'
abstract: We consider learning Ising tree models when the observations from the nodes
  are corrupted by independent but non-identically distributed noise with unknown
  statistics. Katiyar et al. (2020) showed that although the exact tree structure
  cannot be recovered, one can recover a partial tree structure; that is, a structure
  belonging to the equivalence class containing the true tree. This paper presents
  a systematic improvement of Katiyar et al. (2020). First, we present a novel impossibility
  result by deriving a bound on the necessary number of samples for partial recovery.
  Second, we derive a significantly improved sample complexity result in which the
  dependence on the minimum correlation $\rho_{\min}$ is $\rho_{\min}^{-8}$ instead
  of $\rho_{\min}^{-24}$. Finally, we propose Symmetrized Geometric Averaging (SGA),
  a more statistically robust algorithm for partial tree recovery. We provide error
  exponent analyses and extensive numerical results on a variety of trees to show
  that the sample complexity of SGA is significantly better than the algorithm of
  Katiyar et al. (2020). SGA can be readily extended to Gaussian models and is shown
  via numerical experiments to be similarly superior.
