title: Value Alignment Verification
abstract: 'As humans interact with autonomous agents to perform increasingly complicated,
  potentially risky tasks, it is important to be able to efficiently evaluate an agent’s
  performance and correctness. In this paper we formalize and theoretically analyze
  the problem of efficient value alignment verification: how to efficiently test whether
  the behavior of another agent is aligned with a human’s values? The goal is to construct
  a kind of "driver’s test" that a human can give to any agent which will verify value
  alignment via a minimal number of queries. We study alignment verification problems
  with both idealized humans that have an explicit reward function as well as problems
  where they have implicit values. We analyze verification of exact value alignment
  for rational agents, propose and test heuristics for value alignment verification
  in gridworlds and a continuous autonomous driving domain, and prove that there exist
  sufficient conditions such that we can verify epsilon-alignment in any environment
  via a constant-query-complexity alignment test.'
