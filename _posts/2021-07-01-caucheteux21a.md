title: Disentangling syntax and semantics in the brain with deep networks
abstract: 'The activations of language transformers like GPT-2 have been shown to
  linearly map onto brain activity during speech comprehension. However, the nature
  of these activations remains largely unknown and presumably conflate distinct linguistic
  classes. Here, we propose a taxonomy to factorize the high-dimensional activations
  of language models into four combinatorial classes: lexical, compositional, syntactic,
  and semantic representations. We then introduce a statistical method to decompose,
  through the lens of GPT-2’s activations, the brain activity of 345 subjects recorded
  with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during the listening of  4.6 hours
  of narrated text. The results highlight two findings. First, compositional representations
  recruit a more widespread cortical network than lexical ones, and encompass the
  bilateral temporal, parietal and prefrontal cortices. Second, contrary to previous
  claims, syntax and semantics are not associated with separated modules, but, instead,
  appear to share a common and distributed neural substrate. Overall, this study introduces
  a versatile framework to isolate, in the brain activity, the distributed representations
  of linguistic constructs.'
