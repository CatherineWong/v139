title: Efficient Generative Modelling of Protein Structure Fragments using a Deep
  Markov Model
abstract: Fragment libraries are often used in protein structure prediction, simulation
  and design as a means to significantly reduce the vast conformational search space.
  Current state-of-the-art methods for fragment library generation do not properly
  account for aleatory and epistemic uncertainty, respectively due to the dynamic
  nature of proteins and experimental errors in protein structures. Additionally,
  they typically rely on information that is not generally or readily available, such
  as homologous sequences, related protein structures and other complementary information.
  To address these issues, we developed BIFROST, a novel take on the fragment library
  problem based on a Deep Markov Model architecture combined with directional statistics
  for angular degrees of freedom, implemented in the deep probabilistic programming
  language Pyro. BIFROST is a probabilistic, generative model of the protein backbone
  dihedral angles conditioned solely on the amino acid sequence. BIFROST generates
  fragment libraries with a quality on par with current state-of-the-art methods at
  a fraction of the run-time, while requiring considerably less information and allowing
  efficient evaluation of probabilities.
