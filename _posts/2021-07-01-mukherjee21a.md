title: Outlier-Robust Optimal Transport
abstract: Optimal transport (OT) measures distances between distributions in a way
  that depends on the geometry of the sample space. In light of recent advances in
  computational OT, OT distances are widely used as loss functions in machine learning.
  Despite their prevalence and advantages, OT loss functions can be extremely sensitive
  to outliers. In fact, a single adversarially-picked outlier can increase the standard
  $W_2$-distance arbitrarily. To address this issue, we propose an outlier-robust
  formulation of OT. Our formulation is convex but challenging to scale at a first
  glance. Our main contribution is deriving an \emph{equivalent} formulation based
  on cost truncation that is easy to incorporate into modern algorithms for computational
  OT. We demonstrate the benefits of our formulation in mean estimation problems under
  the Huber contamination model in simulations and outlier detection tasks on real
  data.
