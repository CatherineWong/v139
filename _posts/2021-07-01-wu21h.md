title: 'Generative Video Transformer: Can Objects be the Words?'
abstract: Transformers have been successful for many natural language processing tasks.
  However, applying transformers to the video domain for tasks such as long-term video
  generation and scene understanding has remained elusive due to the high computational
  complexity and the lack of natural tokenization. In this paper, we propose the ObjectCentric
  Video Transformer (OCVT) which utilizes an object-centric approach for decomposing
  scenes into tokens suitable for use in a generative video transformer. By factoring
  the video into objects, our fully unsupervised model is able to learn complex spatio-temporal
  dynamics of multiple interacting objects in a scene and generate future frames of
  the video. Our model is also significantly more memory-efficient than pixel-based
  models and thus able to train on videos of length up to 70 frames with a single
  48GB GPU. We compare our model with previous RNN-based approaches as well as other
  possible video transformer baselines. We demonstrate OCVT performs well when compared
  to baselines in generating future frames. OCVT also develops useful representations
  for video reasoning, achieving start-of-the-art performance on the CATER task.
