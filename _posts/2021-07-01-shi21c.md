title: Segmenting Hybrid Trajectories using Latent ODEs
abstract: Smooth dynamics interrupted by discontinuities are known as hybrid systems
  and arise commonly in nature. Latent ODEs allow for powerful representation of irregularly
  sampled time series but are not designed to capture trajectories arising from hybrid
  systems. Here, we propose the Latent Segmented ODE (LatSegODE), which uses Latent
  ODEs to perform reconstruction and changepoint detection within hybrid trajectories
  featuring jump discontinuities and switching dynamical modes. Where it is possible
  to train a Latent ODE on the smooth dynamical flows between discontinuities, we
  apply the pruned exact linear time (PELT) algorithm to detect changepoints where
  latent dynamics restart, thereby maximizing the joint probability of a piece-wise
  continuous latent dynamical representation. We propose usage of the marginal likelihood
  as a score function for PELT, circumventing the need for model-complexity-based
  penalization. The LatSegODE outperforms baselines in reconstructive and segmentation
  tasks including synthetic data sets of sine waves, Lotka Volterra dynamics, and
  UCI Character Trajectories.
