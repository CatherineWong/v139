title: Provably Strict Generalisation Benefit for Equivariant Models
abstract: It is widely believed that engineering a model to be invariant/equivariant
  improves generalisation. Despite the growing popularity of this approach, a precise
  characterisation of the generalisation benefit is lacking. By considering the simplest
  case of linear models, this paper provides the first provably non-zero improvement
  in generalisation for invariant/equivariant models when the target distribution
  is invariant/equivariant with respect to a compact group. Moreover, our work reveals
  an interesting relationship between generalisation, the number of training examples
  and properties of the group action. Our results rest on an observation of the structure
  of function spaces under averaging operators which, along with its consequences
  for feature averaging, may be of independent interest.
