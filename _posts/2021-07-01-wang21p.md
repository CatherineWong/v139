title: 'ConvexVST: A Convex Optimization Approach to Variance-stabilizing Transformation'
abstract: The variance-stabilizing transformation (VST) problem is to transform heteroscedastic
  data to homoscedastic data so that they are more tractable for subsequent analysis.
  However, most of the existing approaches focus on finding an analytical solution
  for a certain parametric distribution, which severely limits the applications, because
  simple distributions cannot faithfully describe the real data while more complicated
  distributions cannot be analytically solved. In this paper, we converted the VST
  problem into a convex optimization problem, which can always be efficiently solved,
  identified the specific structure of the convex problem, which further improved
  the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, and showed that any finite discrete distributions
  and the discretized version of any continuous distributions from real data can be
  variance-stabilized in an easy and nonparametric way. We demonstrated the new approach
  on bioimaging data and achieved superior performance compared to peer algorithms
  in terms of not only the variance homoscedasticity but also the impact on subsequent
  analysis such as denoising. Source codes are available at https://github.com/yu-lab-vt/ConvexVST.
