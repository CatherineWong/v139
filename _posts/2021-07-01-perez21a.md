title: 'Rissanen Data Analysis: Examining Dataset Characteristics via Description
  Length'
abstract: We introduce a method to determine if a certain capability helps to achieve
  an accurate model of given data. We view labels as being generated from the inputs
  by a program composed of subroutines with different capabilities, and we posit that
  a subroutine is useful if and only if the minimal program that invokes it is shorter
  than the one that does not. Since minimum program length is uncomputable, we instead
  estimate the labelsâ€™ minimum description length (MDL) as a proxy, giving us a theoretically-grounded
  method for analyzing dataset characteristics. We call the method Rissanen Data Analysis
  (RDA) after the father of MDL, and we showcase its applicability on a wide variety
  of settings in NLP, ranging from evaluating the utility of generating subquestions
  before answering a question, to analyzing the value of rationales and explanations,
  to investigating the importance of different parts of speech, and uncovering dataset
  gender bias.
