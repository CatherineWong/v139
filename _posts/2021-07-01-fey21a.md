title: 'GNNAutoScale: Scalable and Expressive Graph Neural Networks via Historical
  Embeddings'
abstract: We present GNNAutoScale (GAS), a framework for scaling arbitrary message-passing
  GNNs to large graphs. GAS prunes entire sub-trees of the computation graph by utilizing
  historical embeddings from prior training iterations, leading to constant GPU memory
  consumption in respect to input node size without dropping any data. While existing
  solutions weaken the expressive power of message passing due to sub-sampling of
  edges or non-trainable propagations, our approach is provably able to maintain the
  expressive power of the original GNN. We achieve this by providing approximation
  error bounds of historical embeddings and show how to tighten them in practice.
  Empirically, we show that the practical realization of our framework, PyGAS, an
  easy-to-use extension for PyTorch Geometric, is both fast and memory-efficient,
  learns expressive node representations, closely resembles the performance of their
  non-scaling counterparts, and reaches state-of-the-art performance on large-scale
  graphs.
