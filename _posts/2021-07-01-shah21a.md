title: 'RRL: Resnet as representation for Reinforcement Learning'
abstract: 'The ability to autonomously learn behaviors via direct interactions in
  uninstrumented environments can lead to generalist robots capable of enhancing productivity
  or providing care in unstructured settings like homes. Such uninstrumented settings
  warrant operations only using the robot’s proprioceptive sensor such as onboard
  cameras, joint encoders, etc which can be challenging for policy learning owing
  to the high dimensionality and partial observability issues. We propose RRL: Resnet
  as representation for Reinforcement Learning {–} a straightforward yet effective
  approach that can learn complex behaviors directly from proprioceptive inputs. RRL
  fuses features extracted from pre-trained Resnet into the standard reinforcement
  learning pipeline and delivers results comparable to learning directly from the
  state. In a simulated dexterous manipulation benchmark, where the state of the art
  methods fails to make significant progress, RRL delivers contact rich behaviors.
  The appeal of RRL lies in its simplicity in bringing together progress from the
  fields of Representation Learning, Imitation Learning, and Reinforcement Learning.
  Its effectiveness in learning behaviors directly from visual inputs with performance
  and sample efficiency matching learning directly from the state, even in complex
  high dimensional domains, is far from obvious.'
