title: Randomized Dimensionality Reduction for Facility Location and Single-Linkage
  Clustering
abstract: 'Random dimensionality reduction is a versatile tool for speeding up algorithms
  for high-dimensional problems. We study its application to two clustering problems:
  the facility location problem, and the single-linkage hierarchical clustering problem,
  which is equivalent to computing the minimum spanning tree. We show that if we project
  the input pointset $X$ onto a random $d = O(d_X)$-dimensional subspace (where $d_X$
  is the doubling dimension of $X$), then the optimum facility location cost in the
  projected space approximates the original cost up to a constant factor. We show
  an analogous statement for minimum spanning tree, but with the dimension $d$ having
  an extra $\log \log n$ term and the approximation factor being arbitrarily close
  to $1$. Furthermore, we extend these results to approximating {\em solutions} instead
  of just their {\em costs}. Lastly, we provide experimental results to validate the
  quality of solutions and the speedup due to the dimensionality reduction. Unlike
  several previous papers studying this approach in the context of $k$-means and $k$-medians,
  our dimension bound does not depend on the number of clusters but only on the intrinsic
  dimensionality of $X$.'
