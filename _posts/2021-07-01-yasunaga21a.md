title: 'Break-It-Fix-It: Unsupervised Learning for Program Repair'
abstract: 'We consider repair tasks: given a critic (e.g., compiler) that assesses
  the quality of an input, the goal is to train a fixer that converts a bad example
  (e.g., code with syntax errors) into a good one (e.g., code with no errors). Existing
  works create training data consisting of (bad, good) pairs by corrupting good examples
  using heuristics (e.g., dropping tokens). However, fixers trained on this synthetically-generated
  data do not extrapolate well to the real distribution of bad inputs. To bridge this
  gap, we propose a new training approach, Break-It-Fix-It (BIFI), which has two key
  ideas: (i) we use the critic to check a fixerâ€™s output on real bad inputs and add
  good (fixed) outputs to the training data, and (ii) we train a breaker to generate
  realistic bad code from good code. Based on these ideas, we iteratively update the
  breaker and the fixer while using them in conjunction to generate more paired data.
  We evaluate BIFI on two code repair datasets: GitHub-Python, a new dataset we introduce
  where the goal is to repair Python code with AST parse errors; and DeepFix, where
  the goal is to repair C code with compiler errors. BIFI outperforms existing methods,
  obtaining 90.5% repair accuracy on GitHub-Python (+28.5%) and 71.7% on DeepFix (+5.6%).
  Notably, BIFI does not require any labeled data; we hope it will be a strong starting
  point for unsupervised learning of various repair tasks.'
