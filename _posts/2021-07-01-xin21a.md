title: A Hybrid Variance-Reduced Method for Decentralized Stochastic Non-Convex Optimization
abstract: This paper considers decentralized stochastic optimization over a network
  of $n$ nodes, where each node possesses a smooth non-convex local cost function
  and the goal of the networked nodes is to find an $\epsilon$-accurate first-order
  stationary point of the sum of the local costs. We focus on an online setting, where
  each node accesses its local cost only by means of a stochastic first-order oracle
  that returns a noisy version of the exact gradient. In this context, we propose
  a novel single-loop decentralized hybrid variance-reduced stochastic gradient method,
  called GT-HSGD, that outperforms the existing approaches in terms of both the oracle
  complexity and practical implementation. The GT-HSGD algorithm implements specialized
  local hybrid stochastic gradient estimators that are fused over the network to track
  the global gradient. Remarkably, GT-HSGD achieves a network topology-independent
  oracle complexity of $O(n^{-1}\epsilon^{-3})$ when the required error tolerance
  $\epsilon$ is small enough, leading to a linear speedup with respect to the centralized
  optimal online variance-reduced approaches that operate on a single node. Numerical
  experiments are provided to illustrate our main technical results.
