title: Oneshot Differentially Private Top-k Selection
abstract: Being able to efficiently and accurately select the top-$k$ elements with
  differential privacy is an integral component of various private data analysis tasks.
  In this paper, we present the oneshot Laplace mechanism, which generalizes the well-known
  Report Noisy MaxÂ \cite{dwork2014algorithmic} mechanism to reporting noisy top-$k$
  elements. We show that the oneshot Laplace mechanism with a noise level of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{k}/\eps)$
  is approximately differentially private. Compared to the previous peeling approach
  of running Report Noisy Max $k$ times, the oneshot Laplace mechanism only adds noises
  and computes the top $k$ elements once, hence much more efficient for large $k$.
  In addition, our proof of privacy relies on a novel coupling technique that bypasses
  the composition theorems so without the linear dependence on $k$ which is inherent
  to various composition theorems. Finally, we present a novel application of efficient
  top-$k$ selection in the classical problem of ranking from pairwise comparisons.
