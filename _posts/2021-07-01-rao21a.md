title: MSA Transformer
abstract: Unsupervised protein language models trained across millions of diverse
  sequences learn structure and function of proteins. Protein language models studied
  to date have been trained to perform inference from individual sequences. The longstanding
  approach in computational biology has been to make inferences from a family of evolutionarily
  related sequences by fitting a model to each family independently. In this work
  we combine the two paradigms. We introduce a protein language model which takes
  as input a set of sequences in the form of a multiple sequence alignment. The model
  interleaves row and column attention across the input sequences and is trained with
  a variant of the masked language modeling objective across many protein families.
  The performance of the model surpasses current state-of-the-art unsupervised structure
  learning methods by a wide margin, with far greater parameter efficiency than prior
  state-of-the-art protein language models.
