title: Scaling Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Selective Parameter Sharing
abstract: Sharing parameters in multi-agent deep reinforcement learning has played
  an essential role in allowing algorithms to scale to a large number of agents. Parameter
  sharing between agents significantly decreases the number of trainable parameters,
  shortening training times to tractable levels, and has been linked to more efficient
  learning. However, having all agents share the same parameters can also have a detrimental
  effect on learning. We demonstrate the impact of parameter sharing methods on training
  speed and converged returns, establishing that when applied indiscriminately, their
  effectiveness is highly dependent on the environment. We propose a novel method
  to automatically identify agents which may benefit from sharing parameters by partitioning
  them based on their abilities and goals. Our approach combines the increased sample
  efficiency of parameter sharing with the representational capacity of multiple independent
  networks to reduce training time and increase final returns.
