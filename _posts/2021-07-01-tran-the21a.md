title: Bayesian Optimistic Optimisation with Exponentially Decaying Regret
abstract: Bayesian optimisation (BO) is a well known algorithm for finding the global
  optimum of expensive, black-box functions. The current practical BO algorithms have
  regret bounds ranging from $\mathcal{O}(\frac{logN}{\sqrt{N}})$ to $\mathcal O(e^{-\sqrt{N}})$,
  where $N$ is the number of evaluations. This paper explores the possibility of improving
  the regret bound in the noise-free setting by intertwining concepts from BO and
  optimistic optimisation methods which are based on partitioning the search space.
  We propose the BOO algorithm, a first practical approach which can achieve an exponential
  regret bound with order $\mathcal O(N^{-\sqrt{N}})$ under the assumption that the
  objective function is sampled from a Gaussian process with a MatÃ©rn kernel with
  smoothness parameter $\nu > 4 +\frac{D}{2}$, where $D$ is the number of dimensions.
  We perform experiments on optimisation of various synthetic functions and machine
  learning hyperparameter tuning tasks and show that our algorithm outperforms baselines.
