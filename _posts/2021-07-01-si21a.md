title: Testing Group Fairness via Optimal Transport Projections
abstract: We have developed a statistical testing framework to detect if a given machine
  learning classifier fails to satisfy a wide range of group fairness notions. Our
  test is a flexible, interpretable, and statistically rigorous tool for auditing
  whether exhibited biases are intrinsic to the algorithm or simply due to the randomness
  in the data. The statistical challenges, which may arise from multiple impact criteria
  that define group fairness and which are discontinuous on model parameters, are
  conveniently tackled by projecting the empirical measure to the set of group-fair
  probability models using optimal transport. This statistic is efficiently computed
  using linear programming, and its asymptotic distribution is explicitly obtained.
  The proposed framework can also be used to test for composite fairness hypotheses
  and fairness with multiple sensitive attributes. The optimal transport testing formulation
  improves interpretability by characterizing the minimal covariate perturbations
  that eliminate the bias observed in the audit.
