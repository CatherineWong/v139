title: Self-supervised Graph-level Representation Learning with Local and Global Structure
abstract: This paper studies unsupervised/self-supervised whole-graph representation
  learning, which is critical in many tasks such as molecule properties prediction
  in drug and material discovery. Existing methods mainly focus on preserving the
  local similarity structure between different graph instances but fail to discover
  the global semantic structure of the entire data set. In this paper, we propose
  a unified framework called Local-instance and Global-semantic Learning (GraphLoG)
  for self-supervised whole-graph representation learning. Specifically, besides preserving
  the local similarities, GraphLoG introduces the hierarchical prototypes to capture
  the global semantic clusters. An efficient online expectation-maximization (EM)
  algorithm is further developed for learning the model. We evaluate GraphLoG by pre-training
  it on massive unlabeled graphs followed by fine-tuning on downstream tasks. Extensive
  experiments on both chemical and biological benchmark data sets demonstrate the
  effectiveness of the proposed approach.
