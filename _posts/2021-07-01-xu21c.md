title: Interpretable Stein Goodness-of-fit Tests on Riemannian Manifold
abstract: In many applications, we encounter data on Riemannian manifolds such as
  torus and rotation groups. Standard statistical procedures for multivariate data
  are not applicable to such data. In this study, we develop goodness-of-fit testing
  and interpretable model criticism methods for general distributions on Riemannian
  manifolds, including those with an intractable normalization constant. The proposed
  methods are based on extensions of kernel Stein discrepancy, which are derived from
  Stein operators on Riemannian manifolds. We discuss the connections between the
  proposed tests with existing ones and provide a theoretical analysis of their asymptotic
  Bahadur efficiency. Simulation results and real data applications show the validity
  and usefulness of the proposed methods.
