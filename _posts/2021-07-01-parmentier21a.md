title: Optimal Counterfactual Explanations in Tree Ensembles
abstract: Counterfactual explanations are usually generated through heuristics that
  are sensitive to the searchâ€™s initial conditions. The absence of guarantees of performance
  and robustness hinders trustworthiness. In this paper, we take a disciplined approach
  towards counterfactual explanations for tree ensembles. We advocate for a model-based
  search aiming at "optimal" explanations and propose efficient mixed-integer programming
  approaches. We show that isolation forests can be modeled within our framework to
  focus the search on plausible explanations with a low outlier score. We provide
  comprehensive coverage of additional constraints that model important objectives,
  heterogeneous data types, structural constraints on the feature space, along with
  resource and actionability restrictions. Our experimental analyses demonstrate that
  the proposed search approach requires a computational effort that is orders of magnitude
  smaller than previous mathematical programming algorithms. It scales up to large
  data sets and tree ensembles, where it provides, within seconds, systematic explanations
  grounded on well-defined models solved to optimality.
