title: Modelling Behavioural Diversity for Learning in Open-Ended Games
abstract: Promoting behavioural diversity is critical for solving games with non-transitive
  dynamics where strategic cycles exist, and there is no consistent winner (e.g.,
  Rock-Paper-Scissors). Yet, there is a lack of rigorous treatment for defining diversity
  and constructing diversity-aware learning dynamics. In this work, we offer a geometric
  interpretation of behavioural diversity in games and introduce a novel diversity
  metric based on \emph{determinantal point processes} (DPP). By incorporating the
  diversity metric into best-response dynamics, we develop \emph{diverse fictitious
  play} and \emph{diverse policy-space response oracle} for solving normal-form games
  and open-ended games. We prove the uniqueness of the diverse best response and the
  convergence of our algorithms on two-player games. Importantly, we show that maximising
  the DPP-based diversity metric guarantees to enlarge the \emph{gamescape} – convex
  polytopes spanned by agents’ mixtures of strategies. To validate our diversity-aware
  solvers, we test on tens of games that show strong non-transitivity. Results suggest
  that our methods achieve at least the same, and in most games, lower exploitability
  than PSRO solvers by finding effective and diverse strategies.
