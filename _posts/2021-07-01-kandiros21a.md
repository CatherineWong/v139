title: Statistical Estimation from Dependent Data
abstract: We consider a general statistical estimation problem wherein binary labels
  across different observations are not independent conditioning on their feature
  vectors, but dependent, capturing settings where e.g. these observations are collected
  on a spatial domain, a temporal domain, or a social network, which induce dependencies.
  We model these dependencies in the language of Markov Random Fields and, importantly,
  allow these dependencies to be substantial, i.e. do not assume that the Markov Random
  Field capturing these dependencies is in high temperature. As our main contribution
  we provide algorithms and statistically efficient estimation rates for this model,
  giving several instantiations of our bounds in logistic regression, sparse logistic
  regression, and neural network regression settings with dependent data. Our estimation
  guarantees follow from novel results for estimating the parameters (i.e. external
  fields and interaction strengths) of Ising models from a single sample.
