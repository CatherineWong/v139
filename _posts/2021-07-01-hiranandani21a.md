title: Optimizing Black-box Metrics with Iterative Example Weighting
abstract: We consider learning to optimize a classification metric defined by a black-box
  function of the confusion matrix. Such black-box learning settings are ubiquitous,
  for example, when the learner only has query access to the metric of interest, or
  in noisy-label and domain adaptation applications where the learner must evaluate
  the metric via performance evaluation using a small validation sample. Our approach
  is to adaptively learn example weights on the training dataset such that the resulting
  weighted objective best approximates the metric on the validation sample. We show
  how to model and estimate the example weights and use them to iteratively post-shift
  a pre-trained class probability estimator to construct a classifier. We also analyze
  the resulting procedureâ€™s statistical properties. Experiments on various label noise,
  domain shift, and fair classification setups confirm that our proposal compares
  favorably to the state-of-the-art baselines for each application.
