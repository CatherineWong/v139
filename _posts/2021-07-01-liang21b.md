title: Uncovering the Connections Between Adversarial Transferability and Knowledge
  Transferability
abstract: Knowledge transferability, or transfer learning, has been widely adopted
  to allow a pre-trained model in the source domain to be effectively adapted to downstream
  tasks in the target domain. It is thus important to explore and understand the factors
  affecting knowledge transferability. In this paper, as the first work, we analyze
  and demonstrate the connections between knowledge transferability and another important
  phenomenonâ€“adversarial transferability, \emph{i.e.}, adversarial examples generated
  against one model can be transferred to attack other models. Our theoretical studies
  show that adversarial transferability indicates knowledge transferability, and vice
  versa. Moreover, based on the theoretical insights, we propose two practical adversarial
  transferability metrics to characterize this process, serving as bidirectional indicators
  between adversarial and knowledge transferability. We conduct extensive experiments
  for different scenarios on diverse datasets, showing a positive correlation between
  adversarial transferability and knowledge transferability. Our findings will shed
  light on future research about effective knowledge transfer learning and adversarial
  transferability analyses.
