title: Improved Regret Bound and Experience Replay in Regularized Policy Iteration
abstract: In this work, we study algorithms for learning in infinite-horizon undiscounted
  Markov decision processes (MDPs) with function approximation. We first show that
  the regret analysis of the Politex algorithm (a version of regularized policy iteration)
  can be sharpened from $O(T^{3/4})$ to $O(\sqrt{T})$ under nearly identical assumptions,
  and instantiate the bound with linear function approximation. Our result provides
  the first high-probability $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound for a computationally efficient
  algorithm in this setting. The exact implementation of Politex with neural network
  function approximation is inefficient in terms of memory and computation. Since
  our analysis suggests that we need to approximate the average of the action-value
  functions of past policies well, we propose a simple efficient implementation where
  we train a single Q-function on a replay buffer with past data. We show that this
  often leads to superior performance over other implementation choices, especially
  in terms of wall-clock time. Our work also provides a novel theoretical justification
  for using experience replay within policy iteration algorithms.
