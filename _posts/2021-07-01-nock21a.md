title: The Impact of Record Linkage on Learning from Feature Partitioned Data
abstract: There has been recently a significant boost to machine learning with distributed
  data, in particular with the success of federated learning. A common and very challenging
  setting is that of vertical or feature partitioned data, when multiple data providers
  hold different features about common entities. In general, training needs to be
  preceded by record linkage (RL), a step that finds the correspondence between the
  observations of the datasets. RL is prone to mistakes in the real world. Despite
  the importance of the problem, there has been so far no formal assessment of the
  way in which RL errors impact learning models. Work in the area either use heuristics
  or assume that the optimal RL is known in advance. In this paper, we provide the
  first assessment of the problem for supervised learning. For wide sets of losses,
  we provide technical conditions under which the classifier learned after noisy RL
  converges (with the data size) to the best classifier that would be learned from
  mistake-free RL. This yields new insights on the way the pipeline RL + ML operates,
  from the role of large margin classification on dampening the impact of RL mistakes
  to clues on how to further optimize RL as a preprocessing step to ML. Experiments
  on a large UCI benchmark validate those formal observations.
