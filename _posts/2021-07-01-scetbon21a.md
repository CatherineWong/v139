title: Low-Rank Sinkhorn Factorization
abstract: Several recent applications of optimal transport (OT) theory to machine
  learning have relied on regularization, notably entropy and the Sinkhorn algorithm.
  Because matrix-vector products are pervasive in the Sinkhorn algorithm, several
  works have proposed to \textit{approximate} kernel matrices appearing in its iterations
  using low-rank factors. Another route lies instead in imposing low-nonnegative rank
  constraints on the feasible set of couplings considered in OT problems, with no
  approximations on cost nor kernel matrices. This route was first explored by \citet{forrow2018statistical},
  who proposed an algorithm tailored for the squared Euclidean ground cost, using
  a proxy objective that can be solved through the machinery of regularized 2-Wasserstein
  barycenters. Building on this, we introduce in this work a generic approach that
  aims at solving, in full generality, the OT problem under low-nonnegative rank constraints
  with arbitrary costs. Our algorithm relies on an explicit factorization of low-rank
  couplings as a product of \textit{sub-coupling} factors linked by a common marginal;
  similar to an NMF approach, we alternatively updates these factors. We prove the
  non-asymptotic stationary convergence of this algorithm and illustrate its efficiency
  on benchmark experiments.
