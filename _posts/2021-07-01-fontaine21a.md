title: Online A-Optimal Design and Active Linear Regression
abstract: We consider in this paper the problem of optimal experiment design where
  a decision maker can choose which points to sample to obtain an estimate $\hat{\beta}$
  of the hidden parameter $\beta^{\star}$ of an underlying linear model. The key challenge
  of this work lies in the heteroscedasticity assumption that we make, meaning that
  each covariate has a different and unknown variance. The goal of the decision maker
  is then to figure out on the fly the optimal way to allocate the total budget of
  $T$ samples between covariates, as sampling several times a specific one will reduce
  the variance of the estimated model around it (but at the cost of a possible higher
  variance elsewhere). By trying to minimize the $\ell^2$-loss $\mathbb{E} [\lVert\hat{\beta}-\beta^{\star}\rVert^2]$
  the decision maker is actually minimizing the trace of the covariance matrix of
  the problem, which corresponds then to online A-optimal design. Combining techniques
  from bandit and convex optimization we propose a new active sampling algorithm and
  we compare it with existing ones. We provide theoretical guarantees of this algorithm
  in different settings, including a $\mathcal{O}(T^{-2})$ regret bound in the case
  where the covariates form a basis of the feature space, generalizing and improving
  existing results. Numerical experiments validate our theoretical findings.
