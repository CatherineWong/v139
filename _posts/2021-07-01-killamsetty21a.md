title: 'GRAD-MATCH: Gradient Matching based Data Subset Selection for Efficient Deep
  Model Training'
abstract: 'The great success of modern machine learning models on large datasets is
  contingent on extensive computational resources with high financial and environmental
  costs. One way to address this is by extracting subsets that generalize on par with
  the full data. In this work, we propose a general framework, GRAD-MATCH, which finds
  subsets that closely match the gradient of the \emph{training or validation} set.
  We find such subsets effectively using an orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm.
  We show rigorous theoretical and convergence guarantees of the proposed algorithm
  and, through our extensive experiments on real-world datasets, show the effectiveness
  of our proposed framework. We show that GRAD-MATCH significantly and consistently
  outperforms several recent data-selection algorithms and achieves the best accuracy-efficiency
  trade-off. GRAD-MATCH is available as a part of the CORDS toolkit: \url{https://github.com/decile-team/cords}.'
