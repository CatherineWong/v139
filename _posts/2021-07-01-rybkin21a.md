title: Simple and Effective VAE Training with Calibrated Decoders
abstract: Variational autoencoders (VAEs) provide an effective and simple method for
  modeling complex distributions. However, training VAEs often requires considerable
  hyperparameter tuning to determine the optimal amount of information retained by
  the latent variable. We study the impact of calibrated decoders, which learn the
  uncertainty of the decoding distribution and can determine this amount of information
  automatically, on the VAE performance. While many methods for learning calibrated
  decoders have been proposed, many of the recent papers that employ VAEs rely on
  heuristic hyperparameters and ad-hoc modifications instead. We perform the first
  comprehensive comparative analysis of calibrated decoder and provide recommendations
  for simple and effective VAE training. Our analysis covers a range of datasets and
  several single-image and sequential VAE models. We further propose a simple but
  novel modification to the commonly used Gaussian decoder, which computes the prediction
  variance analytically. We observe empirically that using heuristic modifications
  is not necessary with our method.
