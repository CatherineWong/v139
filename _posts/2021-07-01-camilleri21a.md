title: High-dimensional Experimental Design and Kernel Bandits
abstract: In recent years methods from optimal linear experimental design have been
  leveraged to obtain state of the art results for linear bandits. A design returned
  from an objective such as G-optimal design is actually a probability distribution
  over a pool of potential measurement vectors. Consequently, one nuisance of the
  approach is the task of converting this continuous probability distribution into
  a discrete assignment of N measurements. While sophisticated rounding techniques
  have been proposed, in d dimensions they require N to be at least d, d log(log(d)),
  or d^2 based on the sub-optimality of the solution. In this paper we are interested
  in settings where N may be much less than d, such as in experimental design in an
  RKHS where d may be effectively infinite. In this work, we propose a rounding procedure
  that frees N of any dependence on the dimension d, while achieving nearly the same
  performance guarantees of existing rounding procedures. We evaluate the procedure
  against a baseline that projects the problem to a lower dimensional space and performs
  rounding there, which requires N to just be at least a notion of the effective dimension.
  We also leverage our new approach in a new algorithm for kernelized bandits to obtain
  state of the art results for regret minimization and pure exploration. An advantage
  of our approach over existing UCB-like approaches is that our kernel bandit algorithms
  are provably robust to model misspecification.
