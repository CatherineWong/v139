title: Towards Certifying L-infinity Robustness using Neural Networks with L-inf-dist
  Neurons
abstract: 'It is well-known that standard neural networks, even with a high classification
  accuracy, are vulnerable to small $\ell_\infty$-norm bounded adversarial perturbations.
  Although many attempts have been made, most previous works either can only provide
  empirical verification of the defense to a particular attack method, or can only
  develop a certified guarantee of the model robustness in limited scenarios. In this
  paper, we seek for a new approach to develop a theoretically principled neural network
  that inherently resists $\ell_\infty$ perturbations. In particular, we design a
  novel neuron that uses $\ell_\infty$-distance as its basic operation (which we call
  $\ell_\infty$-dist neuron), and show that any neural network constructed with $\ell_\infty$-dist
  neurons (called $\ell_{\infty}$-dist net) is naturally a 1-Lipschitz function with
  respect to $\ell_\infty$-norm. This directly provides a rigorous guarantee of the
  certified robustness based on the margin of prediction outputs. We then prove that
  such networks have enough expressive power to approximate any 1-Lipschitz function
  with robust generalization guarantee. We further provide a holistic training strategy
  that can greatly alleviate optimization difficulties. Experimental results show
  that using $\ell_{\infty}$-dist nets as basic building blocks, we consistently achieve
  state-of-the-art performance on commonly used datasets: 93.09% certified accuracy
  on MNIST ($\epsilon=0.3$), 35.42% on CIFAR-10 ($\epsilon=8/255$) and 16.31% on TinyImageNet
  ($\epsilon=1/255$).'
