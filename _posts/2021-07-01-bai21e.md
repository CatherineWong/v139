title: 'GLSearch: Maximum Common Subgraph Detection via Learning to Search'
abstract: Detecting the Maximum Common Subgraph (MCS) between two input graphs is
  fundamental for applications in drug synthesis, malware detection, cloud computing,
  etc. However, MCS computation is NP-hard, and state-of-the-art MCS solvers rely
  on heuristic search algorithms which in practice cannot find good solution for large
  graph pairs given a limited computation budget. We propose GLSearch, a Graph Neural
  Network (GNN) based learning to search model. Our model is built upon the branch
  and bound algorithm, which selects one pair of nodes from the two input graphs to
  expand at a time. We propose a novel GNN-based Deep Q-Network (DQN) to select the
  node pair, making the search process much faster. Experiments on synthetic and real-world
  graph pairs demonstrate that our model learns a search strategy that is able to
  detect significantly larger common subgraphs than existing MCS solvers given the
  same computation budget. GLSearch can be potentially extended to solve many other
  combinatorial problems with constraints on graphs.
