title: 'DriftSurf: Stable-State / Reactive-State Learning under Concept Drift'
abstract: When learning from streaming data, a change in the data distribution, also
  known as concept drift, can render a previously-learned model inaccurate and require
  training a new model. We present an adaptive learning algorithm that extends previous
  drift-detection-based methods by incorporating drift detection into a broader stable-state/reactive-state
  process. The advantage of our approach is that we can use aggressive drift detection
  in the stable state to achieve a high detection rate, but mitigate the false positive
  rate of standalone drift detection via a reactive state that reacts quickly to true
  drifts while eliminating most false positives. The algorithm is generic in its base
  learner and can be applied across a variety of supervised learning problems. Our
  theoretical analysis shows that the risk of the algorithm is (i) statistically better
  than standalone drift detection and (ii) competitive to an algorithm with oracle
  knowledge of when (abrupt) drifts occur. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets
  with concept drifts confirm our theoretical analysis.
