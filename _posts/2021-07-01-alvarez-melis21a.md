title: Dataset Dynamics via Gradient Flows in Probability Space
abstract: Various machine learning tasks, from generative modeling to domain adaptation,
  revolve around the concept of dataset transformation and manipulation. While various
  methods exist for transforming unlabeled datasets, principled methods to do so for
  labeled (e.g., classification) datasets are missing. In this work, we propose a
  novel framework for dataset transformation, which we cast as optimization over data-generating
  joint probability distributions. We approach this class of problems through Wasserstein
  gradient flows in probability space, and derive practical and efficient particle-based
  methods for a flexible but well-behaved class of objective functions. Through various
  experiments, we show that this framework can be used to impose constraints on classification
  datasets, adapt them for transfer learning, or to re-purpose fixed or black-box
  models to classify {—}with high accuracy{—} previously unseen datasets.
