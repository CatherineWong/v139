title: Learning Gradient Fields for Molecular Conformation Generation
abstract: We study a fundamental problem in computational chemistry known as molecular
  conformation generation, trying to predict stable 3D structures from 2D molecular
  graphs. Existing machine learning approaches usually first predict distances between
  atoms and then generate a 3D structure satisfying the distances, where noise in
  predicted distances may induce extra errors during 3D coordinate generation. Inspired
  by the traditional force field methods for molecular dynamics simulation, in this
  paper, we propose a novel approach called ConfGF by directly estimating the gradient
  fields of the log density of atomic coordinates. The estimated gradient fields allow
  directly generating stable conformations via Langevin dynamics. However, the problem
  is very challenging as the gradient fields are roto-translation equivariant. We
  notice that estimating the gradient fields of atomic coordinates can be translated
  to estimating the gradient fields of interatomic distances, and hence develop a
  novel algorithm based on recent score-based generative models to effectively estimate
  these gradients. Experimental results across multiple tasks show that ConfGF outperforms
  previous state-of-the-art baselines by a significant margin.
