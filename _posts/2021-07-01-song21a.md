title: Accelerating Feedforward Computation via Parallel Nonlinear Equation Solving
abstract: Feedforward computation, such as evaluating a neural network or sampling
  from an autoregressive model, is ubiquitous in machine learning. The sequential
  nature of feedforward computation, however, requires a strict order of execution
  and cannot be easily accelerated with parallel computing. To enable parallelization,
  we frame the task of feedforward computation as solving a system of nonlinear equations.
  We then propose to find the solution using a Jacobi or Gauss-Seidel fixed-point
  iteration method, as well as hybrid methods of both. Crucially, Jacobi updates operate
  independently on each equation and can be executed in parallel. Our method is guaranteed
  to give exactly the same values as the original feedforward computation with a reduced
  (or equal) number of parallelizable iterations, and hence reduced time given sufficient
  parallel computing power. Experimentally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
  approach in accelerating (i) backpropagation of RNNs, (ii) evaluation of DenseNets,
  and (iii) autoregressive sampling of MADE and PixelCNN++, with speedup factors between
  2.1 and 26 under various settings.
