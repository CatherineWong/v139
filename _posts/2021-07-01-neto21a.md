title: Causality-aware counterfactual confounding adjustment as an alternative to
  linear residualization in anticausal prediction tasks based on linear learners
abstract: Linear residualization is a common practice for confounding adjustment in
  machine learning applications. Recently, causality-aware predictive modeling has
  been proposed as an alternative causality-inspired approach for adjusting for confounders.
  In this paper, we compare the linear residualization approach against the causality-aware
  confounding adjustment in anticausal prediction tasks. Our comparisons include both
  the settings where the training and test sets come from the same distributions,
  as well as, when the training and test sets are shifted due to selection biases.
  In the absence of dataset shifts, we show that the causality-aware approach tends
  to (asymptotically) outperform the residualization adjustment in terms of predictive
  performance in linear learners. Importantly, our results still holds even when the
  true model generating the data is not linear. We illustrate our results in both
  regression and classification tasks. Furthermore, in the presence of dataset shifts
  in the joint distribution of the confounders and outcome variables, we show that
  the causality-aware approach is more stable than linear residualization.
