title: Hyperparameter Selection for Imitation Learning
abstract: We address the issue of tuning hyperparameters (HPs) for imitation learning
  algorithms in the context of continuous-control, when the underlying reward function
  of the demonstrating expert cannot be observed at any time. The vast literature
  in imitation learning mostly considers this reward function to be available for
  HP selection, but this is not a realistic setting. Indeed, would this reward function
  be available, it could then directly be used for policy training and imitation would
  not be necessary. To tackle this mostly ignored problem, we propose a number of
  possible proxies to the external reward. We evaluate them in an extensive empirical
  study (more than 10’000 agents across 9 environments) and make practical recommendations
  for selecting HPs. Our results show that while imitation learning algorithms are
  sensitive to HP choices, it is often possible to select good enough HPs through
  a proxy to the reward function.
