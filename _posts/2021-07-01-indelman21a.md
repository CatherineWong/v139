title: Learning Randomly Perturbed Structured Predictors for Direct Loss Minimization
abstract: Direct loss minimization is a popular approach for learning predictors over
  structured label spaces. This approach is computationally appealing as it replaces
  integration with optimization and allows to propagate gradients in a deep net using
  loss-perturbed prediction. Recently, this technique was extended to generative models,
  by introducing a randomized predictor that samples a structure from a randomly perturbed
  score function. In this work, we interpolate between these techniques by learning
  the variance of randomized structured predictors as well as their mean, in order
  to balance between the learned score function and the randomized noise. We demonstrate
  empirically the effectiveness of learning this balance in structured discrete spaces.
