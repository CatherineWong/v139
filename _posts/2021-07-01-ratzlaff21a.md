title: Generative Particle Variational Inference via Estimation of Functional Gradients
abstract: Recently, particle-based variational inference (ParVI) methods have gained
  interest because they can avoid arbitrary parametric assumptions that are common
  in variational inference. However, many ParVI approaches do not allow arbitrary
  sampling from the posterior, and the few that do allow such sampling suffer from
  suboptimality. This work proposes a new method for learning to approximately sample
  from the posterior distribution. We construct a neural sampler that is trained with
  the functional gradient of the KL-divergence between the empirical sampling distribution
  and the target distribution, assuming the gradient resides within a reproducing
  kernel Hilbert space. Our generative ParVI (GPVI) approach maintains the asymptotic
  performance of ParVI methods while offering the flexibility of a generative sampler.
  Through carefully constructed experiments, we show that GPVI outperforms previous
  generative ParVI methods such as amortized SVGD, and is competitive with ParVI as
  well as gold-standard approaches like Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for fitting both exactly
  known and intractable target distributions.
