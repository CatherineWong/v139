title: 'Accuracy on the Line: on the Strong Correlation Between Out-of-Distribution
  and In-Distribution Generalization'
abstract: For machine learning systems to be reliable, we must understand their performance
  in unseen, out- of-distribution environments. In this paper, we empirically show
  that out-of-distribution performance is strongly correlated with in-distribution
  performance for a wide range of models and distribution shifts. Specifically, we
  demonstrate strong correlations between in-distribution and out-of- distribution
  performance on variants of CIFAR- 10 & ImageNet, a synthetic pose estimation task
  derived from YCB objects, FMoW-WILDS satellite imagery classification, and wildlife
  classification in iWildCam-WILDS. The correlation holds across model architectures,
  hyperparameters, training set size, and training duration, and is more precise than
  what is expected from existing domain adaptation theory. To complete the picture,
  we also investigate cases where the correlation is weaker, for instance some synthetic
  distribution shifts from CIFAR-10-C and the tissue classification dataset Camelyon17-WILDS.
  Finally, we provide a candidate theory based on a Gaussian data model that shows
  how changes in the data covariance arising from distribution shift can affect the
  observed correlations.
