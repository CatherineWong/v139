title: Efficient Online Learning for Dynamic k-Clustering
abstract: In this work, we study dynamic clustering problems from the perspective
  of online learning. We consider an online learning problem, called \textit{Dynamic
  $k$-Clustering}, in which $k$ centers are maintained in a metric space over time
  (centers may change positions) such as a dynamically changing set of $r$ clients
  is served in the best possible way. The connection cost at round $t$ is given by
  the \textit{$p$-norm} of the vector formed by the distance of each client to its
  closest center at round $t$, for some $p\geq 1$. We design a \textit{$\Theta\left(
  \min(k,r) \right)$-regret} polynomial-time online learning algorithm, while we show
  that, under some well-established computational complexity conjectures, \textit{constant-regret}
  cannot be achieved in polynomial-time. In addition to the efficient solution of
  Dynamic $k$-Clustering, our work contributes to the long line of research of combinatorial
  online learning.
