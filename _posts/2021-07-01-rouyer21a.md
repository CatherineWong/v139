title: An Algorithm for Stochastic and Adversarial Bandits with Switching Costs
abstract: We propose an algorithm for stochastic and adversarial multiarmed bandits
  with switching costs, where the algorithm pays a price $\lambda$ every time it switches
  the arm being played. Our algorithm is based on adaptation of the Tsallis-INF algorithm
  of Zimmert and Seldin (2021) and requires no prior knowledge of the regime or time
  horizon. In the oblivious adversarial setting it achieves the minimax optimal regret
  bound of $ O( (\lambda K)^{1/3}T^{2/3} + \sqrt{KT})$, where $T$ is the time horizon
  and $K$ is the number of arms. In the stochastically constrained adversarial regime,
  which includes the stochastic regime as a special case, it achieves a regret bound
  of $O((\lambda K)^{2/3} T^{1/3} + \ln T)\sum_{i \neq i^*} \Delta_i^{-1})$, where
  $\Delta_i$ are suboptimality gaps and $i^*$ is the unique optimal arm. In the special
  case of $\lambda = 0$ (no switching costs), both bounds are minimax optimal within
  constants. We also explore variants of the problem, where switching cost is allowed
  to change over time. We provide experimental evaluation showing competitiveness
  of our algorithm with the relevant baselines in the stochastic, stochastically constrained
  adversarial, and adversarial regimes with fixed switching cost.
