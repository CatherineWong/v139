title: 'CombOptNet: Fit the Right NP-Hard Problem by Learning Integer Programming
  Constraints'
abstract: Bridging logical and algorithmic reasoning with modern machine learning
  techniques is a fundamental challenge with potentially transformative impact. On
  the algorithmic side, many NP-hard problems can be expressed as integer programs,
  in which the constraints play the role of their ’combinatorial specification’. In
  this work, we aim to integrate integer programming solvers into neural network architectures
  as layers capable of learning both the cost terms and the constraints. The resulting
  end-to-end trainable architectures jointly extract features from raw data and solve
  a suitable (learned) combinatorial problem with state-of-the-art integer programming
  solvers. We demonstrate the potential of such layers with an extensive performance
  analysis on synthetic data and with a demonstration on a competitive computer vision
  keypoint matching benchmark.
