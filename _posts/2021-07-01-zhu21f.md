title: Commutative Lie Group VAE for Disentanglement Learning
abstract: We view disentanglement learning as discovering an underlying structure
  that equivariantly reflects the factorized variations shown in data. Traditionally,
  such a structure is fixed to be a vector space with data variations represented
  by translations along individual latent dimensions. We argue this simple structure
  is suboptimal since it requires the model to learn to discard the properties (e.g.
  different scales of changes, different levels of abstractness) of data variations,
  which is an extra work than equivariance learning. Instead, we propose to encode
  the data variations with groups, a structure not only can equivariantly represent
  variations, but can also be adaptively optimized to preserve the properties of data
  variations. Considering it is hard to conduct training on group structures, we focus
  on Lie groups and adopt a parameterization using Lie algebra. Based on the parameterization,
  some disentanglement learning constraints are naturally derived. A simple model
  named Commutative Lie Group VAE is introduced to realize the group-based disentanglement
  learning. Experiments show that our model can effectively learn disentangled representations
  without supervision, and can achieve state-of-the-art performance without extra
  constraints.
