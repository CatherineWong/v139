title: Training Adversarially Robust Sparse Networks via Bayesian Connectivity Sampling
abstract: Deep neural networks have been shown to be susceptible to adversarial attacks.
  This lack of adversarial robustness is even more pronounced when models are compressed
  in order to meet hardware limitations. Hence, if adversarial robustness is an issue,
  training of sparsely connected networks necessitates considering adversarially robust
  sparse learning. Motivated by the efficient and stable computational function of
  the brain in the presence of a highly dynamic synaptic connectivity structure, we
  propose an intrinsically sparse rewiring approach to train neural networks with
  state-of-the-art robust learning objectives under high sparsity. Importantly, in
  contrast to previously proposed pruning techniques, our approach satisfies global
  connectivity constraints throughout robust optimization, i.e., it does not require
  dense pre-training followed by pruning. Based on a Bayesian posterior sampling principle,
  a network rewiring process simultaneously learns the sparse connectivity structure
  and the robustness-accuracy trade-off based on the adversarial learning objective.
  Although our networks are sparsely connected throughout the whole training process,
  our experimental benchmark evaluations show that their performance is superior to
  recently proposed robustness-aware network pruning methods which start from densely
  connected networks.
