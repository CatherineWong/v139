title: Revenue-Incentive Tradeoffs in Dynamic Reserve Pricing
abstract: Online advertisements are primarily sold via repeated auctions with reserve
  prices. In this paper, we study how to set reserves to boost revenue based on the
  historical bids of strategic buyers, while controlling the impact of such a policy
  on the incentive compatibility of the repeated auctions. Adopting an incentive compatibility
  metric which quantifies the incentives to shade bids, we propose a novel class of
  reserve pricing policies and provide analytical tradeoffs between their revenue
  performance and bid-shading incentives. The policies are inspired by the exponential
  mechanism from the literature on differential privacy, but our study uncovers mechanisms
  with significantly better revenue-incentive tradeoffs than the exponential mechanism
  in practice. We further empirically evaluate the tradeoffs on synthetic data as
  well as real ad auction data from a major ad exchange to verify and support our
  theoretical findings.
