title: Counterfactual Credit Assignment in Model-Free Reinforcement Learning
abstract: Credit assignment in reinforcement learning is the problem of measuring
  an action’s influence on future rewards. In particular, this requires separating
  skill from luck, i.e. disentangling the effect of an action on rewards from that
  of external factors and subsequent actions. To achieve this, we adapt the notion
  of counterfactuals from causality theory to a model-free RL setup. The key idea
  is to condition value functions on future events, by learning to extract relevant
  information from a trajectory. We formulate a family of policy gradient algorithms
  that use these future-conditional value functions as baselines or critics, and show
  that they are provably low variance. To avoid the potential bias from conditioning
  on future information, we constrain the hindsight information to not contain information
  about the agent’s actions. We demonstrate the efficacy and validity of our algorithm
  on a number of illustrative and challenging problems.
