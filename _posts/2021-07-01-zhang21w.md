title: 'MetaCURE: Meta Reinforcement Learning with Empowerment-Driven Exploration'
abstract: Meta reinforcement learning (meta-RL) extracts knowledge from previous tasks
  and achieves fast adaptation to new tasks. Despite recent progress, efficient exploration
  in meta-RL remains a key challenge in sparse-reward tasks, as it requires quickly
  finding informative task-relevant experiences in both meta-training and adaptation.
  To address this challenge, we explicitly model an exploration policy learning problem
  for meta-RL, which is separated from exploitation policy learning, and introduce
  a novel empowerment-driven exploration objective, which aims to maximize information
  gain for task identification. We derive a corresponding intrinsic reward and develop
  a new off-policy meta-RL framework, which efficiently learns separate context-aware
  exploration and exploitation policies by sharing the knowledge of task inference.
  Experimental evaluation shows that our meta-RL method significantly outperforms
  state-of-the-art baselines on various sparse-reward MuJoCo locomotion tasks and
  more complex sparse-reward Meta-World tasks.
