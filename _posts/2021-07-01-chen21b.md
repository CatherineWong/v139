title: Unsupervised Learning of Visual 3D Keypoints for Control
abstract: Learning sensorimotor control policies from high-dimensional images crucially
  relies on the quality of the underlying visual representations. Prior works show
  that structured latent space such as visual keypoints often outperforms unstructured
  representations for robotic control. However, most of these representations, whether
  structured or unstructured are learned in a 2D space even though the control tasks
  are usually performed in a 3D environment. In this work, we propose a framework
  to learn such a 3D geometric structure directly from images in an end-to-end unsupervised
  manner. The input images are embedded into latent 3D keypoints via a differentiable
  encoder which is trained to optimize both a multi-view consistency loss and downstream
  task objective. These discovered 3D keypoints tend to meaningfully capture robot
  joints as well as object movements in a consistent manner across both time and 3D
  space. The proposed approach outperforms prior state-of-art methods across a variety
  of reinforcement learning benchmarks. Code and videos at https://buoyancy99.github.io/unsup-3d-keypoints/.
