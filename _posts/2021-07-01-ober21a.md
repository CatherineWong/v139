title: Global inducing point variational posteriors for Bayesian neural networks and
  deep Gaussian processes
abstract: We consider the optimal approximate posterior over the top-layer weights
  in a Bayesian neural network for regression, and show that it exhibits strong dependencies
  on the lower-layer weights. We adapt this result to develop a correlated approximate
  posterior over the weights at all layers in a Bayesian neural network. We extend
  this approach to deep Gaussian processes, unifying inference in the two model classes.
  Our approximate posterior uses learned "global” inducing points, which are defined
  only at the input layer and propagated through the network to obtain inducing inputs
  at subsequent layers. By contrast, standard, "local”, inducing point methods from
  the deep Gaussian process literature optimise a separate set of inducing inputs
  at every layer, and thus do not model correlations across layers. Our method gives
  state-of-the-art performance for a variational Bayesian method, without data augmentation
  or tempering, on CIFAR-10 of 86.7%, which is comparable to SGMCMC without tempering
  but with data augmentation (88% in Wenzel et al. 2020).
