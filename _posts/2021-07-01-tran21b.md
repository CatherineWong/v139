title: 'SMG: A Shuffling Gradient-Based Method with Momentum'
abstract: 'We combine two advanced ideas widely used in optimization for machine learning:
  \textit{shuffling} strategy and \textit{momentum} technique to develop a novel shuffling
  gradient-based method with momentum, coined \textbf{S}huffling \textbf{M}omentum
  \textbf{G}radient (SMG), for non-convex finite-sum optimization problems. While
  our method is inspired by momentum techniques, its update is fundamentally different
  from existing momentum-based methods. We establish state-of-the-art convergence
  rates of SMG for any shuffling strategy using either constant or diminishing learning
  rate under standard assumptions (i.e. \textit{$L$-smoothness} and \textit{bounded
  variance}). When the shuffling strategy is fixed, we develop another new algorithm
  that is similar to existing momentum methods, and prove the same convergence rates
  for this algorithm under the $L$-smoothness and bounded gradient assumptions. We
  demonstrate our algorithms via numerical simulations on standard datasets and compare
  them with existing shuffling methods. Our tests have shown encouraging performance
  of the new algorithms.'
