title: Learning de-identified representations of prosody from raw audio
abstract: We propose a method for learning de-identified prosody representations from
  raw audio using a contrastive self-supervised signal. Whereas prior work has relied
  on conditioning models with bottlenecks, we introduce a set of inductive biases
  that exploit the natural structure of prosody to minimize timbral information and
  decouple prosody from speaker representations. Despite aggressive downsampling of
  the input and having no access to linguistic information, our model performs comparably
  to state-of-the-art speech representations on DAMMP, a new benchmark we introduce
  for spoken language understanding. We use minimum description length probing to
  show that our representations have selectively learned the subcomponents of non-timbral
  prosody, and that the product quantizer naturally disentangles them without using
  bottlenecks. We derive an information-theoretic definition of speech de-identifiability
  and use it to demonstrate that our prosody representations are less identifiable
  than the other speech representations.
