title: Few-Shot Neural Architecture Search
abstract: 'Efficient evaluation of a network architecture drawn from a large search
  space remains a key challenge in Neural Architecture Search (NAS). Vanilla NAS evaluates
  each architecture by training from scratch, which gives the true performance but
  is extremely time-consuming. Recently, one-shot NAS substantially reduces the computation
  cost by training only one supernetwork, a.k.a. supernet, to approximate the performance
  of every architecture in the search space via weight-sharing. However, the performance
  estimation can be very inaccurate due to the co-adaption among operations. In this
  paper, we propose few-shot NAS that uses multiple supernetworks, called sub-supernet,
  each covering different regions of the search space to alleviate the undesired co-adaption.
  Compared to one-shot NAS, few-shot NAS improves the accuracy of architecture evaluation
  with a small increase of evaluation cost. With only up to 7 sub-supernets, few-shot
  NAS establishes new SoTAs: on ImageNet, it finds models that reach 80.5% top-1 accuracy
  at 600 MB FLOPS and 77.5% top-1 accuracy at 238 MFLOPS; on CIFAR10, it reaches 98.72%
  top-1 accuracy without using extra data or transfer learning. In Auto-GAN, few-shot
  NAS outperforms the previously published results by up to 20%. Extensive experiments
  show that few-shot NAS significantly improves various one-shot methods, including
  4 gradient-based and 6 search-based methods on 3 different tasks in NasBench-201
  and NasBench1-shot-1.'
