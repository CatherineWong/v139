title: Conservative Objective Models for Effective Offline Model-Based Optimization
abstract: In this paper, we aim to solve data-driven model-based optimization (MBO)
  problems, where the goal is to find a design input that maximizes an unknown objective
  function provided access to only a static dataset of inputs and their corresponding
  objective values. Such data-driven optimization procedures are the only practical
  methods in many real-world domains where active data collection is expensive (e.g.,
  when optimizing over proteins) or dangerous (e.g., when optimizing over aircraft
  designs, actively evaluating malformed aircraft designs is unsafe). Typical methods
  for MBO that optimize the input against a learned model of the unknown score function
  are affected by erroneous overestimation in the learned model caused due to distributional
  shift, that drives the optimizer to low-scoring or invalid inputs. To overcome this,
  we propose conservative objective models (COMs), a method that learns a model of
  the objective function which lower bounds the actual value of the ground-truth objective
  on out-of-distribution inputs and uses it for optimization. In practice, COMs outperform
  a number existing methods on a wide range of MBO problems, including optimizing
  controller parameters, robot morphologies, and superconducting materials.
