title: Near-Optimal Linear Regression under Distribution Shift
abstract: Transfer learning is essential when sufficient data comes from the source
  domain, with scarce labeled data from the target domain. We develop estimators that
  achieve minimax linear risk for linear regression problems under distribution shift.
  Our algorithms cover different transfer learning settings including covariate shift
  and model shift. We also consider when data are generated from either linear or
  general nonlinear models. We show that linear minimax estimators are within an absolute
  constant of the minimax risk even among nonlinear estimators for various source/target
  distributions.
