title: Leveraging Non-uniformity in First-order Non-convex Optimization
abstract: 'Classical global convergence results for first-order methods rely on uniform
  smoothness and the Ł{}ojasiewicz inequality. Motivated by properties of objective
  functions that arise in machine learning, we propose a non-uniform refinement of
  these notions, leading to \emph{Non-uniform Smoothness} (NS) and \emph{Non-uniform
  Ł{}ojasiewicz inequality} (NŁ{}). The new definitions inspire new geometry-aware
  first-order methods that are able to converge to global optimality faster than the
  classical $\Omega(1/t^2)$ lower bounds. To illustrate the power of these geometry-aware
  methods and their corresponding non-uniform analysis, we consider two important
  problems in machine learning: policy gradient optimization in reinforcement learning
  (PG), and generalized linear model training in supervised learning (GLM). For PG,
  we find that normalizing the gradient ascent method can accelerate convergence to
  $O(e^{- c \cdot t})$ (where $c > 0$) while incurring less overhead than existing
  algorithms. For GLM, we show that geometry-aware normalized gradient descent can
  also achieve a linear convergence rate, which significantly improves the best known
  results. We additionally show that the proposed geometry-aware gradient descent
  methods escape landscape plateaus faster than standard gradient descent. Experimental
  results are used to illustrate and complement the theoretical findings.'
