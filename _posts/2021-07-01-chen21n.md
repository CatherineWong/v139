title: Large-Margin Contrastive Learning with Distance Polarization Regularizer
abstract: "\\emph{Contrastive learning} (CL) pretrains models in a pairwise manner,
  where given a data point, other data points are all regarded as dissimilar, including
  some that are \\emph{semantically} similar. The issue has been addressed by properly
  weighting similar and dissimilar pairs as in \\emph{positive-unlabeled learning},
  so that the objective of CL is \\emph{unbiased} and CL is \\emph{consistent}. However,
  in this paper, we argue that this great solution is still not enough: its weighted
  objective \\emph{hides} the issue where the semantically similar pairs are still
  pushed away; as CL is pretraining, this phenomenon is not our desideratum and might
  affect downstream tasks. To this end, we propose \\emph{large-margin contrastive
  learning} (LMCL) with \\emph{distance polarization regularizer}, motivated by the
  distribution characteristic of pairwise distances in \\emph{metric learning}. In
  LMCL, we can distinguish between \\emph{intra-cluster} and \\emph{inter-cluster}
  pairs, and then only push away inter-cluster pairs, which \\emph{solves} the above
  issue explicitly. Theoretically, we prove a tighter error bound for LMCL; empirically,
  the superiority of LMCL is demonstrated across multiple domains, \\emph{i.e.}, image
  classification, sentence representation, and reinforcement learning."
