title: 'Sample Efficient Reinforcement Learning In Continuous State Spaces: A Perspective
  Beyond Linearity'
abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is empirically successful in complex nonlinear
  Markov decision processes (MDPs) with continuous state spaces. By contrast, the
  majority of theoretical RL literature requires the MDP to satisfy some form of linear
  structure, in order to guarantee sample efficient RL. Such efforts typically assume
  the transition dynamics or value function of the MDP are described by linear functions
  of the state features. To resolve this discrepancy between theory and practice,
  we introduce the Effective Planning Window (EPW) condition, a structural condition
  on MDPs that makes no linearity assumptions. We demonstrate that the EPW condition
  permits sample efficient RL, by providing an algorithm which provably solves MDPs
  satisfying this condition. Our algorithm requires minimal assumptions on the policy
  class, which can include multi-layer neural networks with nonlinear activation functions.
  Notably, the EPW condition is directly motivated by popular gaming benchmarks, and
  we show that many classic Atari games satisfy this condition. We additionally show
  the necessity of conditions like EPW, by demonstrating that simple MDPs with slight
  nonlinearities cannot be solved sample efficiently.
