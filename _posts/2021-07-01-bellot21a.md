title: Policy Analysis using Synthetic Controls in Continuous-Time
abstract: Counterfactual estimation using synthetic controls is one of the most successful
  recent methodological developments in causal inference. Despite its popularity,
  the current description only considers time series aligned across units and synthetic
  controls expressed as linear combinations of observed control units. We propose
  a continuous-time alternative that models the latent counterfactual path explicitly
  using the formalism of controlled differential equations. This model is directly
  applicable to the general setting of irregularly-aligned multivariate time series
  and may be optimized in rich function spaces â€“ thereby improving on some limitations
  of existing approaches.
