title: 'PODS: Policy Optimization via Differentiable Simulation'
abstract: Current reinforcement learning (RL) methods use simulation models as simple
  black-box oracles. In this paper, with the goal of improving the performance exhibited
  by RL algorithms, we explore a systematic way of leveraging the additional information
  provided by an emerging class of differentiable simulators. Building on concepts
  established by Deterministic Policy Gradients (DPG) methods, the neural network
  policies learned with our approach represent deterministic actions. In a departure
  from standard methodologies, however, learning these policies does not hinge on
  approximations of the value function that must be learned concurrently in an actor-critic
  fashion. Instead, we exploit differentiable simulators to directly compute the analytic
  gradient of a policyâ€™s value function with respect to the actions it outputs. This,
  in turn, allows us to efficiently perform locally optimal policy improvement iterations.
  Compared against other state-of-the-art RL methods, we show that with minimal hyper-parameter
  tuning our approach consistently leads to better asymptotic behavior across a set
  of payload manipulation tasks that demand a high degree of accuracy and precision.
