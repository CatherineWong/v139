title: Sparsity-Agnostic Lasso Bandit
abstract: We consider a stochastic contextual bandit problem where the dimension $d$
  of the feature vectors is potentially large, however, only a sparse subset of features
  of cardinality $s_0 \ll d$ affect the reward function. Essentially all existing
  algorithms for sparse bandits require a priori knowledge of the value of the sparsity
  index $s_0$. This knowledge is almost never available in practice, and misspecification
  of this parameter can lead to severe deterioration in the performance of existing
  methods. The main contribution of this paper is to propose an algorithm that does
  not require prior knowledge of the sparsity index $s_0$ and establish tight regret
  bounds on its performance under mild conditions. We also comprehensively evaluate
  our proposed algorithm numerically and show that it consistently outperforms existing
  methods, even when the correct sparsity index is revealed to them but is kept hidden
  from our algorithm.
