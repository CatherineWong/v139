title: 'Heterogeneity for the Win: One-Shot Federated Clustering'
abstract: 'In this work, we explore the unique challenges—and opportunities—of unsupervised
  federated learning (FL). We develop and analyze a one-shot federated clustering
  scheme, kfed, based on the widely-used Lloyd’s method for $k$-means clustering.
  In contrast to many supervised problems, we show that the issue of statistical heterogeneity
  in federated networks can in fact benefit our analysis. We analyse kfed under a
  center separation assumption and compare it to the best known requirements of its
  centralized counterpart. Our analysis shows that in heterogeneous regimes where
  the number of clusters per device $(k’)$ is smaller than the total number of clusters
  over the network $k$, $(k’\le \sqrt{k})$, we can use heterogeneity to our advantage—significantly
  weakening the cluster separation requirements for kfed. From a practical viewpoint,
  kfed also has many desirable properties: it requires only round of communication,
  can run asynchronously, and can handle partial participation or node/network failures.
  We motivate our analysis with experiments on common FL benchmarks, and highlight
  the practical utility of one-shot clustering through use-cases in personalized FL
  and device sampling.'
