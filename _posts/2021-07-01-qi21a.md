title: 'BANG: Bridging Autoregressive and Non-autoregressive Generation with Large
  Scale Pretraining'
abstract: In this paper, we propose BANG, a new pretraining model to Bridge the gap
  between Autoregressive (AR) and Non-autoregressive (NAR) Generation. AR and NAR
  generation can be uniformly regarded as to what extent previous tokens can be attended,
  and BANG bridges AR and NAR generation through designing a novel model structure
  for large-scale pre-training. A pretrained BANG model can simultaneously support
  AR, NAR, and semi-NAR generation to meet different requirements. Experiments on
  question generation (SQuAD 1.1), summarization (XSum), and dialogue generation (PersonaChat)
  show that BANG improves NAR and semi-NAR performance significantly as well as attaining
  comparable performance with strong AR pretrained models. Compared with the semi-NAR
  strong baselines, BANG achieves absolute improvements of 14.01 and 5.24 in the overall
  scores of SQuAD 1.1 and XSum, respectively. In addition, BANG achieves absolute
  improvements of 10.73, 6.39, and 5.90 in the overall scores of SQuAD, XSUM, and
  PersonaChat compared with the NAR strong baselines, respectively. Our code will
  be made publicly available.
