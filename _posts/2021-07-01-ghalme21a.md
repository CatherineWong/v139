title: Strategic Classification in the Dark
abstract: Strategic classification studies the interaction between a classification
  rule and the strategic agents it governs. Agents respond by manipulating their features,
  under the assumption that the classifier is known. However, in many real-life scenarios
  of high-stake classification (e.g., credit scoring), the classifier is not revealed
  to the agents, which leads agents to attempt to learn the classifier and game it
  too. In this paper we generalize the strategic classification model to such scenarios
  and analyze the effect of an unknown classifier. We define the ”price of opacity”
  as the difference between the prediction error under the opaque and transparent
  policies, characterize it, and give a sufficient condition for it to be strictly
  positive, in which case transparency is the recommended policy. Our experiments
  show how Hardt et al.’s robust classifier is affected by keeping agents in the dark.
