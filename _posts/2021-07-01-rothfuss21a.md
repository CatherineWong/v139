title: 'PACOH: Bayes-Optimal Meta-Learning with PAC-Guarantees'
abstract: Meta-learning can successfully acquire useful inductive biases from data.
  Yet, its generalization properties to unseen learning tasks are poorly understood.
  Particularly if the number of meta-training tasks is small, this raises concerns
  about overfitting. We provide a theoretical analysis using the PAC-Bayesian framework
  and derive novel generalization bounds for meta-learning. Using these bounds, we
  develop a class of PAC-optimal meta-learning algorithms with performance guarantees
  and a principled meta-level regularization. Unlike previous PAC-Bayesian meta-learners,
  our method results in a standard stochastic optimization problem which can be solved
  efficiently and scales well.When instantiating our PAC-optimal hyper-posterior (PACOH)
  with Gaussian processes and Bayesian Neural Networks as base learners, the resulting
  methods yield state-of-the-art performance, both in terms of predictive accuracy
  and the quality of uncertainty estimates. Thanks to their principled treatment of
  uncertainty, our meta-learners can also be successfully employed for sequential
  decision problems.
