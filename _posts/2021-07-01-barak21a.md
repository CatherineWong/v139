title: Approximating a Distribution Using Weight Queries
abstract: 'We consider a novel challenge: approximating a distribution without the
  ability to randomly sample from that distribution. We study how such an approximation
  can be obtained using *weight queries*. Given some data set of examples, a weight
  query presents one of the examples to an oracle, which returns the probability,
  according to the target distribution, of observing examples similar to the presented
  example. This oracle can represent, for instance, counting queries to a database
  of the target population, or an interface to a search engine which returns the number
  of results that match a given search. We propose an interactive algorithm that iteratively
  selects data set examples and performs corresponding weight queries. The algorithm
  finds a reweighting of the data set that approximates the weights according to the
  target distribution, using a limited number of weight queries. We derive an approximation
  bound on the total variation distance between the reweighting found by the algorithm
  and the best achievable reweighting. Our algorithm takes inspiration from the UCB
  approach common in multi-armed bandits problems, and combines it with a new discrepancy
  estimator and a greedy iterative procedure. In addition to our theoretical guarantees,
  we demonstrate in experiments the advantages of the proposed algorithm over several
  baselines. A python implementation of the proposed algorithm and of all the experiments
  can be found at https://github.com/Nadav-Barak/AWP.'
