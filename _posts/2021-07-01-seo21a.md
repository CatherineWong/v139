title: State Entropy Maximization with Random Encoders for Efficient Exploration
abstract: Recent exploration methods have proven to be a recipe for improving sample-efficiency
  in deep reinforcement learning (RL). However, efficient exploration in high-dimensional
  observation spaces still remains a challenge. This paper presents Random Encoders
  for Efficient Exploration (RE3), an exploration method that utilizes state entropy
  as an intrinsic reward. In order to estimate state entropy in environments with
  high-dimensional observations, we utilize a k-nearest neighbor entropy estimator
  in the low-dimensional representation space of a convolutional encoder. In particular,
  we find that the state entropy can be estimated in a stable and compute-efficient
  manner by utilizing a randomly initialized encoder, which is fixed throughout training.
  Our experiments show that RE3 significantly improves the sample-efficiency of both
  model-free and model-based RL methods on locomotion and navigation tasks from DeepMind
  Control Suite and MiniGrid benchmarks. We also show that RE3 allows learning diverse
  behaviors without extrinsic rewards, effectively improving sample-efficiency in
  downstream tasks.
