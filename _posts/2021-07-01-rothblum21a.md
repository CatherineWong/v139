title: Multi-group Agnostic PAC Learnability
abstract: 'An agnostic PAC learning algorithm finds a predictor that is competitive
  with the best predictor in a benchmark hypothesis class, where competitiveness is
  measured with respect to a given loss function. However, its predictions might be
  quite sub-optimal for structured subgroups of individuals, such as protected demographic
  groups. Motivated by such fairness concerns, we study “multi-group agnostic PAC
  learnability”: fixing a measure of loss, a benchmark class $\H$ and a (potentially)
  rich collection of subgroups $\G$, the objective is to learn a single predictor
  such that the loss experienced by every group $g \in \G$ is not much larger than
  the best possible loss for this group within $\H$. Under natural conditions, we
  provide a characterization of the loss functions for which such a predictor is guaranteed
  to exist. For any such loss function we construct a learning algorithm whose sample
  complexity is logarithmic in the size of the collection $\G$. Our results unify
  and extend previous positive and negative results from the multi-group fairness
  literature, which applied for specific loss functions.'
