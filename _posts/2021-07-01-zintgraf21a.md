title: Exploration in Approximate Hyper-State Space for Meta Reinforcement Learning
abstract: "To rapidly learn a new task, it is often essential for agents to explore
  efficiently - especially when performance matters from the first timestep. One way
  to learn such behaviour is via meta-learning. Many existing methods however rely
  on dense rewards for meta-training, and can fail catastrophically if the rewards
  are sparse. \tWithout a suitable reward signal, the need for exploration during
  meta-training is exacerbated. To address this, we propose HyperX, which uses novel
  reward bonuses for meta-training to explore in approximate hyper-state space (where
  hyper-states represent the environment state and the agentâ€™s task belief). We show
  empirically that HyperX meta-learns better task-exploration and adapts more successfully
  to new tasks than existing methods."
