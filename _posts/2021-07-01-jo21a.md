title: Discrete-Valued Latent Preference Matrix Estimation with Graph Side Information
abstract: Incorporating graph side information into recommender systems has been widely
  used to better predict ratings, but relatively few works have focused on theoretical
  guarantees. Ahn et al. (2018) firstly characterized the optimal sample complexity
  in the presence of graph side information, but the results are limited due to strict,
  unrealistic assumptions made on the unknown latent preference matrix and the structure
  of user clusters. In this work, we propose a new model in which 1) the unknown latent
  preference matrix can have any discrete values, and 2) users can be clustered into
  multiple clusters, thereby relaxing the assumptions made in prior work. Under this
  new model, we fully characterize the optimal sample complexity and develop a computationally-efficient
  algorithm that matches the optimal sample complexity. Our algorithm is robust to
  model errors and outperforms the existing algorithms in terms of prediction performance
  on both synthetic and real data.
