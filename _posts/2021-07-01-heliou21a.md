title: Zeroth-Order Non-Convex Learning via Hierarchical Dual Averaging
abstract: 'We propose a hierarchical version of dual averaging for zeroth-order online
  non-convex optimization {–} i.e., learning processes where, at each stage, the optimizer
  is facing an unknown non-convex loss function and only receives the incurred loss
  as feedback. The proposed class of policies relies on the construction of an online
  model that aggregates loss information as it arrives, and it consists of two principal
  components: (a) a regularizer adapted to the Fisher information metric (as opposed
  to the metric norm of the ambient space); and (b) a principled exploration of the
  problem’s state space based on an adapted hierarchical schedule. This construction
  enables sharper control of the model’s bias and variance, and allows us to derive
  tight bounds for both the learner’s static and dynamic regret {–} i.e., the regret
  incurred against the best dynamic policy in hindsight over the horizon of play.'
