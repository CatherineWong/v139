title: 'I-BERT: Integer-only BERT Quantization'
abstract: Transformer based models, like BERT and RoBERTa, have achieved state-of-the-art
  results in many Natural Language Processing tasks. However, their memory footprint,
  inference latency, and power consumption are prohibitive efficient inference at
  the edge, and even at the data center. While quantization can be a viable solution
  for this, previous work on quantizing Transformer based models use floating-point
  arithmetic during inference, which cannot efficiently utilize integer-only logical
  units such as the recent Turing Tensor Cores, or traditional integer-only ARM processors.
  In this work, we propose I-BERT, a novel quantization scheme for Transformer based
  models that quantizes the entire inference with integer-only arithmetic. Based on
  lightweight integer-only approximation methods for nonlinear operations, e.g., GELU,
  Softmax, and Layer Normalization, I-BERT performs an end-to-end integer-only BERT
  inference without any floating point calculation. We evaluate our approach on GLUE
  downstream tasks using RoBERTa-Base/Large. We show that for both cases, I-BERT achieves
  similar (and slightly higher) accuracy as compared to the full-precision baseline.
  Furthermore, our preliminary implementation of I-BERT shows a speedup of 2.4- 4.0x
  for INT8 inference on a T4 GPU system as compared to FP32 inference. The framework
  has been developed in PyTorch and has been open-sourced.
