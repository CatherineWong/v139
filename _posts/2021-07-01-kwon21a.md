title: Targeted Data Acquisition for Evolving Negotiation Agents
abstract: Successful negotiators must learn how to balance optimizing for self-interest
  and cooperation. Yet current artificial negotiation agents often heavily depend
  on the quality of the static datasets they were trained on, limiting their capacity
  to fashion an adaptive response balancing self-interest and cooperation. For this
  reason, we find that these agents can achieve either high utility or cooperation,
  but not both. To address this, we introduce a targeted data acquisition framework
  where we guide the exploration of a reinforcement learning agent using annotations
  from an expert oracle. The guided exploration incentivizes the learning agent to
  go beyond its static dataset and develop new negotiation strategies. We show that
  this enables our agents to obtain higher-reward and more Pareto-optimal solutions
  when negotiating with both simulated and human partners compared to standard supervised
  learning and reinforcement learning methods. This trend additionally holds when
  comparing agents using our targeted data acquisition framework to variants of agents
  trained with a mix of supervised learning and reinforcement learning, or to agents
  using tailored reward functions that explicitly optimize for utility and Pareto-optimality.
