title: A Precise Performance Analysis of Support Vector Regression
abstract: In this paper, we study the hard and soft support vector regression techniques
  applied to a set of $n$ linear measurements of the form $y_i=\boldsymbol{\beta}_\star^{T}{\bf
  x}_i +n_i$ where $\boldsymbol{\beta}_\star$ is an unknown vector, $\left\{{\bf x}_i\right\}_{i=1}^n$
  are the feature vectors and $\left\{{n}_i\right\}_{i=1}^n$ model the noise. Particularly,
  under some plausible assumptions on the statistical distribution of the data, we
  characterize the feasibility condition for the hard support vector regression in
  the regime of high dimensions and, when feasible, derive an asymptotic approximation
  for its risk. Similarly, we study the test risk for the soft support vector regression
  as a function of its parameters. Our results are then used to optimally tune the
  parameters intervening in the design of hard and soft support vector regression
  algorithms. Based on our analysis, we illustrate that adding more samples may be
  harmful to the test performance of support vector regression, while it is always
  beneficial when the parameters are optimally selected. Such a result reminds a similar
  phenomenon observed in modern learning architectures according to which optimally
  tuned architectures present a decreasing test performance curve with respect to
  the number of samples.
