title: Differentiable Particle Filtering via Entropy-Regularized Optimal Transport
abstract: Particle Filtering (PF) methods are an established class of procedures for
  performing inference in non-linear state-space models. Resampling is a key ingredient
  of PF necessary to obtain low variance likelihood and states estimates. However,
  traditional resampling methods result in PF-based loss functions being non-differentiable
  with respect to model and PF parameters. In a variational inference context, resampling
  also yields high variance gradient estimates of the PF-based evidence lower bound.
  By leveraging optimal transport ideas, we introduce a principled differentiable
  particle filter and provide convergence results. We demonstrate this novel method
  on a variety of applications.
