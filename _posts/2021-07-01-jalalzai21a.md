title: Feature Clustering for Support Identification in Extreme Regions
abstract: Understanding the complex structure of multivariate extremes is a major
  challenge in various fields from portfolio monitoring and environmental risk management
  to insurance. In the framework of multivariate Extreme Value Theory, a common characterization
  of extremes’ dependence structure is the angular measure. It is a suitable measure
  to work in extreme regions as it provides meaningful insights concerning the subregions
  where extremes tend to concentrate their mass. The present paper develops a novel
  optimization-based approach to assess the dependence structure of extremes. This
  support identification scheme rewrites as estimating clusters of features which
  best capture the support of extremes. The dimension reduction technique we provide
  is applied to statistical learning tasks such as feature clustering and anomaly
  detection. Numerical experiments provide strong empirical evidence of the relevance
  of our approach.
