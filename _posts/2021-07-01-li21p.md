title: Active Feature Acquisition with Generative Surrogate Models
abstract: Many real-world situations allow for the acquisition of additional relevant
  information when making an assessment with limited or uncertain data. However, traditional
  ML approaches either require all features to be acquired beforehand or regard part
  of them as missing data that cannot be acquired. In this work, we consider models
  that perform active feature acquisition (AFA) and query the environment for unobserved
  features to improve the prediction assessments at evaluation time. Our work reformulates
  the Markov decision process (MDP) that underlies the AFA problem as a generative
  modeling task and optimizes a policy via a novel model-based approach. We propose
  learning a generative surrogate model (GSM) that captures the dependencies among
  input features to assess potential information gain from acquisitions. The GSM is
  leveraged to provide intermediate rewards and auxiliary information to aid the agent
  navigate a complicated high-dimensional action space and sparse rewards. Furthermore,
  we extend AFA in a task we coin active instance recognition (AIR) for the unsupervised
  case where the target variables are the unobserved features themselves and the goal
  is to collect information for a particular instance in a cost-efficient way. Empirical
  results demonstrate that our approach achieves considerably better performance than
  previous state of the art methods on both supervised and unsupervised tasks.
