title: Asynchronous Decentralized Optimization With Implicit Stochastic Variance Reduction
abstract: A novel asynchronous decentralized optimization method that follows Stochastic
  Variance Reduction (SVR) is proposed. Average consensus algorithms, such as Decentralized
  Stochastic Gradient Descent (DSGD), facilitate distributed training of machine learning
  models. However, the gradient will drift within the local nodes due to statistical
  heterogeneity of the subsets of data residing on the nodes and long communication
  intervals. To overcome the drift problem, (i) Gradient Tracking-SVR (GT-SVR) integrates
  SVR into DSGD and (ii) Edge-Consensus Learning (ECL) solves a model constrained
  minimization problem using a primal-dual formalism. In this paper, we reformulate
  the update procedure of ECL such that it implicitly includes the gradient modification
  of SVR by optimally selecting a constraint-strength control parameter. Through convergence
  analysis and experiments, we confirmed that the proposed ECL with Implicit SVR (ECL-ISVR)
  is stable and approximately reaches the reference performance obtained with computation
  on a single-node using full data set.
