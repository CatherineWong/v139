title: Inferring Latent Dynamics Underlying Neural Population Activity via Neural
  Differential Equations
abstract: An important problem in systems neuroscience is to identify the latent dynamics
  underlying neural population activity. Here we address this problem by introducing
  a low-dimensional nonlinear model for latent neural population dynamics using neural
  ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs), with noisy sensory inputs and Poisson
  spike train outputs. We refer to this as the Poisson Latent Neural Differential
  Equations (PLNDE) model. We apply the PLNDE framework to a variety of synthetic
  datasets, and show that it accurately infers the phase portraits and fixed points
  of nonlinear systems augmented to produce spike train data, including the FitzHugh-Nagumo
  oscillator, a 3-dimensional nonlinear spiral, and a nonlinear sensory decision-making
  model with attractor dynamics. Our model significantly outperforms existing methods
  at inferring single-trial neural firing rates and the corresponding latent trajectories
  that generated them, especially in the regime where the spike counts and number
  of trials are low. We then apply our model to multi-region neural population recordings
  from medial frontal cortex of rats performing an auditory decision-making task.
  Our model provides a general, interpretable framework for investigating the neural
  mechanisms of decision-making and other cognitive computations through the lens
  of dynamical systems.
