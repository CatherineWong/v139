title: 'SUNRISE: A Simple Unified Framework for Ensemble Learning in Deep Reinforcement
  Learning'
abstract: 'Off-policy deep reinforcement learning (RL) has been successful in a range
  of challenging domains. However, standard off-policy RL algorithms can suffer from
  several issues, such as instability in Q-learning and balancing exploration and
  exploitation. To mitigate these issues, we present SUNRISE, a simple unified ensemble
  method, which is compatible with various off-policy RL algorithms. SUNRISE integrates
  two key ingredients: (a) ensemble-based weighted Bellman backups, which re-weight
  target Q-values based on uncertainty estimates from a Q-ensemble, and (b) an inference
  method that selects actions using the highest upper-confidence bounds for efficient
  exploration. By enforcing the diversity between agents using Bootstrap with random
  initialization, we show that these different ideas are largely orthogonal and can
  be fruitfully integrated, together further improving the performance of existing
  off-policy RL algorithms, such as Soft Actor-Critic and Rainbow DQN, for both continuous
  and discrete control tasks on both low-dimensional and high-dimensional environments.'
