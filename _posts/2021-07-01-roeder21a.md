title: On Linear Identifiability of Learned Representations
abstract: 'Identifiability is a desirable property of a statistical model: it implies
  that the true model parameters may be estimated to any desired precision, given
  sufficient computational resources and data. We study identifiability in the context
  of representation learning: discovering nonlinear data representations that are
  optimal with respect to some downstream task. When parameterized as deep neural
  networks, such representation functions lack identifiability in parameter space,
  because they are over-parameterized by design. In this paper, building on recent
  advances in nonlinear Independent Components Analysis, we aim to rehabilitate identifiability
  by showing that a large family of discriminative models are in fact identifiable
  in function space, up to a linear indeterminacy. Many models for representation
  learning in a wide variety of domains have been identifiable in this sense, including
  text, images and audio, state-of-the-art at time of publication. We derive sufficient
  conditions for linear identifiability and provide empirical support for the result
  on both simulated and real-world data.'
