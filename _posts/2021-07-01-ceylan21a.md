title: Learning Node Representations Using Stationary Flow Prediction on Large Payment
  and Cash Transaction Networks
abstract: 'Banks are required to analyse large transaction datasets as a part of the
  fight against financial crime. Today, this analysis is either performed manually
  by domain experts or using expensive feature engineering. Gradient flow analysis
  allows for basic representation learning as node potentials can be inferred directly
  from network transaction data. However, the gradient model has a fundamental limitation:
  it cannot represent all types of of network flows. Furthermore, standard methods
  for learning the gradient flow are not appropriate for flow signals that span multiple
  orders of magnitude and contain outliers, i.e. transaction data. In this work, the
  gradient model is extended to a gated version and we prove that it, unlike the gradient
  model, is a universal approximator for flows on graphs. To tackle the mentioned
  challenges of transaction data, we propose a multi-scale and outlier robust loss
  function based on the Student-t log-likelihood. Ethereum transaction data is used
  for evaluation and the gradient models outperform MLP models using hand-engineered
  and node2vec features in terms of relative error. These results extend to 60 synthetic
  datasets, with experiments also showing that the gated gradient model learns qualitative
  information about the underlying synthetic generative flow distributions.'
