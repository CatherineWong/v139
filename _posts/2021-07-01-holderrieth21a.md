title: 'Equivariant Learning of Stochastic Fields: Gaussian Processes and Steerable
  Conditional Neural Processes'
abstract: Motivated by objects such as electric fields or fluid streams, we study
  the problem of learning stochastic fields, i.e. stochastic processes whose samples
  are fields like those occurring in physics and engineering. Considering general
  transformations such as rotations and reflections, we show that spatial invariance
  of stochastic fields requires an inference model to be equivariant. Leveraging recent
  advances from the equivariance literature, we study equivariance in two classes
  of models. Firstly, we fully characterise equivariant Gaussian processes. Secondly,
  we introduce Steerable Conditional Neural Processes (SteerCNPs), a new, fully equivariant
  member of the Neural Process family. In experiments with Gaussian process vector
  fields, images, and real-world weather data, we observe that SteerCNPs significantly
  improve the performance of previous models and equivariance leads to improvements
  in transfer learning tasks.
