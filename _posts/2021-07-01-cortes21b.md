title: A Discriminative Technique for Multiple-Source Adaptation
abstract: We present a new discriminative technique for the multiple-source adaptation
  (MSA) problem. Unlike previous work, which relies on density estimation for each
  source domain, our solution only requires conditional probabilities that can be
  straightforwardly accurately estimated from unlabeled data from the source domains.
  We give a detailed analysis of our new technique, including general guarantees based
  on RÃ©nyi divergences, and learning bounds when conditional Maxent is used for estimating
  conditional probabilities for a point to belong to a source domain. We show that
  these guarantees compare favorably to those that can be derived for the generative
  solution, using kernel density estimation. Our experiments with real-world applications
  further demonstrate that our new discriminative MSA algorithm outperforms the previous
  generative solution as well as other domain adaptation baselines.
