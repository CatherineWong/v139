title: Cooperative Exploration for Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning
abstract: 'Exploration is critical for good results in deep reinforcement learning
  and has attracted much attention. However, existing multi-agent deep reinforcement
  learning algorithms still use mostly noise-based techniques. Very recently, exploration
  methods that consider cooperation among multiple agents have been developed. However,
  existing methods suffer from a common challenge: agents struggle to identify states
  that are worth exploring, and hardly coordinate exploration efforts toward those
  states. To address this shortcoming, in this paper, we propose cooperative multi-agent
  exploration (CMAE): agents share a common goal while exploring. The goal is selected
  from multiple projected state spaces by a normalized entropy-based technique. Then,
  agents are trained to reach the goal in a coordinated manner. We demonstrate that
  CMAE consistently outperforms baselines on various tasks, including a sparse-reward
  version of multiple-particle environment (MPE) and the Starcraft multi-agent challenge
  (SMAC).'
