title: Parameterless Transductive Feature Re-representation for Few-Shot Learning
abstract: Recent literature in few-shot learning (FSL) has shown that transductive
  methods often outperform their inductive counterparts. However, most transductive
  solutions, particularly the meta-learning based ones, require inserting trainable
  parameters on top of some inductive baselines to facilitate transduction. In this
  paper, we propose a parameterless transductive feature re-representation framework
  that differs from all existing solutions from the following perspectives. (1) It
  is widely compatible with existing FSL methods, including meta-learning and fine
  tuning based models. (2) The framework is simple and introduces no extra training
  parameters when applied to any architecture. We conduct experiments on three benchmark
  datasets by applying the framework to both representative meta-learning baselines
  and state-of-the-art FSL methods. Our framework consistently improves performances
  in all experiments and refreshes the state-of-the-art FSL results.
