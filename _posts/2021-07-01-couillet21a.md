title: 'Two-way kernel matrix puncturing: towards resource-efficient PCA and spectral
  clustering'
abstract: 'The article introduces an elementary cost and storage reduction method
  for spectral clustering and principal component analysis. The method consists in
  randomly “puncturing” both the data matrix $X\in\mathbb{C}^{p\times n}$ (or $\mathbb{R}^{p\times
  n}$) and its corresponding kernel (Gram) matrix $K$ through Bernoulli masks: $S\in\{0,1\}^{p\times
  n}$ for $X$ and $B\in\{0,1\}^{n\times n}$ for $K$. The resulting “two-way punctured”
  kernel is thus given by $K=\frac1p[(X\odot S)^\H (X\odot S)]\odot B$. We demonstrate
  that, for $X$ composed of independent columns drawn from a Gaussian mixture model,
  as $n,p\to\infty$ with $p/n\to c_0\in(0,\infty)$, the spectral behavior of $K$ –
  its limiting eigenvalue distribution, as well as its isolated eigenvalues and eigenvectors
  – is fully tractable and exhibits a series of counter-intuitive phenomena. We notably
  prove, and empirically confirm on various image databases, that it is possible to
  drastically puncture the data, thereby providing possibly huge computational and
  storage gains, for a virtually constant (clustering or PCA) performance. This preliminary
  study opens as such the path towards rethinking, from a large dimensional standpoint,
  computational and storage costs in elementary machine learning models.'
