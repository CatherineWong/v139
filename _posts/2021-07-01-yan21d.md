title: 'On Perceptual Lossy Compression: The Cost of Perceptual Reconstruction and
  An Optimal Training Framework'
abstract: Lossy compression algorithms are typically designed to achieve the lowest
  possible distortion at a given bit rate. However, recent studies show that pursuing
  high perceptual quality would lead to increase of the lowest achievable distortion
  (e.g., MSE). This paper provides nontrivial results theoretically revealing that,
  1) the cost of achieving perfect perception quality is exactly a doubling of the
  lowest achievable MSE distortion, 2) an optimal encoder for the “classic” rate-distortion
  problem is also optimal for the perceptual compression problem, 3) distortion loss
  is unnecessary for training a perceptual decoder. Further, we propose a novel training
  framework to achieve the lowest MSE distortion under perfect perception constraint
  at a given bit rate. This framework uses a GAN with discriminator conditioned on
  an MSE-optimized encoder, which is superior over the traditional framework using
  distortion plus adversarial loss. Experiments are provided to verify the theoretical
  finding and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed training framework.
