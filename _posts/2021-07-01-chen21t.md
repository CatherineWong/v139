title: Large-Scale Multi-Agent Deep FBSDEs
abstract: In this paper we present a scalable deep learning framework for finding
  Markovian Nash Equilibria in multi-agent stochastic games using fictitious play.
  The motivation is inspired by theoretical analysis of Forward Backward Stochastic
  Differential Equations and their implementation in a deep learning setting, which
  is the source of our algorithmâ€™s sample efficiency improvement. By taking advantage
  of the permutation-invariant property of agents in symmetric games, the scalability
  and performance is further enhanced significantly. We showcase superior performance
  of our framework over the state-of-the-art deep fictitious play algorithm on an
  inter-bank lending/borrowing problem in terms of multiple metrics. More importantly,
  our approach scales up to 3000 agents in simulation, a scale which, to the best
  of our knowledge, represents a new state-of-the-art. We also demonstrate the applicability
  of our framework in robotics on a belief space autonomous racing problem.
