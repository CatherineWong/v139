title: Examining and Combating Spurious Features under Distribution Shift
abstract: A central goal of machine learning is to learn robust representations that
  capture the fundamental relationship between inputs and output labels. However,
  minimizing training errors over finite or biased datasets results in models latching
  on to spurious correlations between the training input/output pairs that are not
  fundamental to the problem at hand. In this paper, we define and analyze robust
  and spurious representations using the information-theoretic concept of minimal
  sufficient statistics. We prove that even when there is only bias of the input distribution
  (i.e. covariate shift), models can still pick up spurious features from their training
  data. Group distributionally robust optimization (DRO) provides an effective tool
  to alleviate covariate shift by minimizing the worst-case training losses over a
  set of pre-defined groups. Inspired by our analysis, we demonstrate that group DRO
  can fail when groups do not directly account for various spurious correlations that
  occur in the data. To address this, we further propose to minimize the worst-case
  losses over a more flexible set of distributions that are defined on the joint distribution
  of groups and instances, instead of treating each group as a whole at optimization
  time. Through extensive experiments on one image and two language tasks, we show
  that our model is significantly more robust than comparable baselines under various
  partitions.
