title: Progressive-Scale Boundary Blackbox Attack via Projective Gradient Estimation
abstract: Boundary based blackbox attack has been recognized as practical and effective,
  given that an attacker only needs to access the final model prediction. However,
  the query efficiency of it is in general high especially for high dimensional image
  data. In this paper, we show that such efficiency highly depends on the scale at
  which the attack is applied, and attacking at the optimal scale significantly improves
  the efficiency. In particular, we propose a theoretical framework to analyze and
  show three key characteristics to improve the query efficiency. We prove that there
  exists an optimal scale for projective gradient estimation. Our framework also explains
  the satisfactory performance achieved by existing boundary black-box attacks. Based
  on our theoretical framework, we propose Progressive-Scale enabled projective Boundary
  Attack (PSBA) to improve the query efficiency via progressive scaling techniques.
  In particular, we employ Progressive-GAN to optimize the scale of projections, which
  we call PSBA-PGAN. We evaluate our approach on both spatial and frequency scales.
  Extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, CelebA, and ImageNet against different
  models including a real-world face recognition API show that PSBA-PGAN significantly
  outperforms existing baseline attacks in terms of query efficiency and attack success
  rate. We also observe relatively stable optimal scales for different models and
  datasets. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/AI-secure/PSBA.
