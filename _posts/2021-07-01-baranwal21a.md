title: 'Graph Convolution for Semi-Supervised Classification: Improved Linear Separability
  and Out-of-Distribution Generalization'
abstract: Recently there has been increased interest in semi-supervised classification
  in the presence of graphical information. A new class of learning models has emerged
  that relies, at its most basic level, on classifying the data after first applying
  a graph convolution. To understand the merits of this approach, we study the classification
  of a mixture of Gaussians, where the data corresponds to the node attributes of
  a stochastic block model. We show that graph convolution extends the regime in which
  the data is linearly separable by a factor of roughly $1/\sqrt{D}$, where $D$ is
  the expected degree of a node, as compared to the mixture model data on its own.
  Furthermore, we find that the linear classifier obtained by minimizing the cross-entropy
  loss after the graph convolution generalizes to out-of-distribution data where the
  unseen data can have different intra- and inter-class edge probabilities from the
  training data.
