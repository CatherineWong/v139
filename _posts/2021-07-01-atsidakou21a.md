title: Combinatorial Blocking Bandits with Stochastic Delays
abstract: 'Recent work has considered natural variations of the {\em multi-armed bandit}
  problem, where the reward distribution of each arm is a special function of the
  time passed since its last pulling. In this direction, a simple (yet widely applicable)
  model is that of {\em blocking bandits}, where an arm becomes unavailable for a
  deterministic number of rounds after each play. In this work, we extend the above
  model in two directions: (i) We consider the general combinatorial setting where
  more than one arms can be played at each round, subject to feasibility constraints.
  (ii) We allow the blocking time of each arm to be stochastic. We first study the
  computational/unconditional hardness of the above setting and identify the necessary
  conditions for the problem to become tractable (even in an approximate sense). Based
  on these conditions, we provide a tight analysis of the approximation guarantee
  of a natural greedy heuristic that always plays the maximum expected reward feasible
  subset among the available (non-blocked) arms. When the armsâ€™ expected rewards are
  unknown, we adapt the above heuristic into a bandit algorithm, based on UCB, for
  which we provide sublinear (approximate) regret guarantees, matching the theoretical
  lower bounds in the limiting case of absence of delays.'
