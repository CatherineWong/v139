title: Scalable Optimal Transport in High Dimensions for Graph Distances, Embedding
  Alignment, and More
abstract: 'The current best practice for computing optimal transport (OT) is via entropy
  regularization and Sinkhorn iterations. This algorithm runs in quadratic time as
  it requires the full pairwise cost matrix, which is prohibitively expensive for
  large sets of objects. In this work we propose two effective log-linear time approximations
  of the cost matrix: First, a sparse approximation based on locality sensitive hashing
  (LSH) and, second, a Nystr{ö}m approximation with LSH-based sparse corrections,
  which we call locally corrected Nystr{ö}m (LCN). These approximations enable general
  log-linear time algorithms for entropy-regularized OT that perform well even for
  the complex, high-dimensional spaces common in deep learning. We analyse these approximations
  theoretically and evaluate them experimentally both directly and end-to-end as a
  component for real-world applications. Using our approximations for unsupervised
  word embedding alignment enables us to speed up a state-of-the-art method by a factor
  of 3 while also improving the accuracy by 3.1 percentage points without any additional
  model changes. For graph distance regression we propose the graph transport network
  (GTN), which combines graph neural networks (GNNs) with enhanced Sinkhorn. GTN outcompetes
  previous models by 48% and still scales log-linearly in the number of nodes.'
