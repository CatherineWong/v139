title: On Robust Mean Estimation under Coordinate-level Corruption
abstract: We study the problem of robust mean estimation and introduce a novel Hamming
  distance-based measure of distribution shift for coordinate-level corruptions. We
  show that this measure yields adversary models that capture more realistic corruptions
  than those used in prior works, and present an information-theoretic analysis of
  robust mean estimation in these settings. We show that for structured distributions,
  methods that leverage the structure yield information theoretically more accurate
  mean estimation. We also focus on practical algorithms for robust mean estimation
  and study when data cleaning-inspired approaches that first fix corruptions in the
  input data and then perform robust mean estimation can match the information theoretic
  bounds of our analysis. We finally demonstrate experimentally that this two-step
  approach outperforms structure-agnostic robust estimation and provides accurate
  mean estimation even for high-magnitude corruption.
