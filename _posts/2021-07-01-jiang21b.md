title: Prioritized Level Replay
abstract: Environments with procedurally generated content serve as important benchmarks
  for testing systematic generalization in deep reinforcement learning. In this setting,
  each level is an algorithmically created environment instance with a unique configuration
  of its factors of variation. Training on a prespecified subset of levels allows
  for testing generalization to unseen levels. What can be learned from a level depends
  on the current policy, yet prior work defaults to uniform sampling of training levels
  independently of the policy. We introduce Prioritized Level Replay (PLR), a general
  framework for selectively sampling the next training level by prioritizing those
  with higher estimated learning potential when revisited in the future. We show TD-errors
  effectively estimate a level’s future learning potential and, when used to guide
  the sampling procedure, induce an emergent curriculum of increasingly difficult
  levels. By adapting the sampling of training levels, PLR significantly improves
  sample-efficiency and generalization on Procgen Benchmark—matching the previous
  state-of-the-art in test return—and readily combines with other methods. Combined
  with the previous leading method, PLR raises the state-of-the-art to over 76% improvement
  in test return relative to standard RL baselines.
