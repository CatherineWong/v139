title: Learning to Generate Noise for Multi-Attack Robustness
abstract: Adversarial learning has emerged as one of the successful techniques to
  circumvent the susceptibility of existing methods against adversarial perturbations.
  However, the majority of existing defense methods are tailored to defend against
  a single category of adversarial perturbation (e.g. $\ell_\infty$-attack). In safety-critical
  applications, this makes these methods extraneous as the attacker can adopt diverse
  adversaries to deceive the system. Moreover, training on multiple perturbations
  simultaneously significantly increases the computational overhead during training.
  To address these challenges, we propose a novel meta-learning framework that explicitly
  learns to generate noise to improve the modelâ€™s robustness against multiple types
  of attacks. Its key component is \emph{Meta Noise Generator (MNG)} that outputs
  optimal noise to stochastically perturb a given sample, such that it helps lower
  the error on diverse adversarial perturbations. By utilizing samples generated by
  MNG, we train a model by enforcing the label consistency across multiple perturbations.
  We validate the robustness of models trained by our scheme on various datasets and
  against a wide variety of perturbations, demonstrating that it significantly outperforms
  the baselines across multiple perturbations with a marginal computational cost.
