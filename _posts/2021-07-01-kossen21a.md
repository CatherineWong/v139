title: 'Active Testing: Sample-Efficient Model Evaluation'
abstract: We introduce a new framework for sample-efficient model evaluation that
  we call active testing. While approaches like active learning reduce the number
  of labels needed for model training, existing literature largely ignores the cost
  of labeling test data, typically unrealistically assuming large test sets for model
  evaluation. This creates a disconnect to real applications, where test labels are
  important and just as expensive, e.g. for optimizing hyperparameters. Active testing
  addresses this by carefully selecting the test points to label, ensuring model evaluation
  is sample-efficient. To this end, we derive theoretically-grounded and intuitive
  acquisition strategies that are specifically tailored to the goals of active testing,
  noting these are distinct to those of active learning. As actively selecting labels
  introduces a bias; we further show how to remove this bias while reducing the variance
  of the estimator at the same time. Active testing is easy to implement and can be
  applied to any supervised machine learning method. We demonstrate its effectiveness
  on models including WideResNets and Gaussian processes on datasets including Fashion-MNIST
  and CIFAR-100.
