title: Reserve Price Optimization for First Price Auctions in Display Advertising
abstract: The display advertising industry has recently transitioned from second-
  to first-price auctions as its primary mechanism for ad allocation and pricing.
  In light of this, publishers need to re-evaluate and optimize their auction parameters,
  notably reserve prices. In this paper, we propose a gradient-based algorithm to
  adaptively update and optimize reserve prices based on estimates of biddersâ€™ responsiveness
  to experimental shocks in reserves. Our key innovation is to draw on the inherent
  structure of the revenue objective in order to reduce the variance of gradient estimates
  and improve convergence rates in both theory and practice. We show that revenue
  in a first-price auction can be usefully decomposed into a \emph{demand} component
  and a \emph{bidding} component, and introduce techniques to reduce the variance
  of each component. We characterize the bias-variance trade-offs of these techniques
  and validate the performance of our proposed algorithm through experiments on synthetic
  data and real display ad auctions data from a major ad exchange.
