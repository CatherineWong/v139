title: Towards Understanding and Mitigating Social Biases in Language Models
abstract: As machine learning methods are deployed in real-world settings such as
  healthcare, legal systems, and social science, it is crucial to recognize how they
  shape social biases and stereotypes in these sensitive decision-making processes.
  Among such real-world deployments are large-scale pretrained language models (LMs)
  that can be potentially dangerous in manifesting undesirable representational biases
  - harmful biases resulting from stereotyping that propagate negative generalizations
  involving gender, race, religion, and other social constructs. As a step towards
  improving the fairness of LMs, we carefully define several sources of representational
  biases before proposing new benchmarks and metrics to measure them. With these tools,
  we propose steps towards mitigating social biases during text generation. Our empirical
  results and human evaluation demonstrate effectiveness in mitigating bias while
  retaining crucial contextual information for high-fidelity text generation, thereby
  pushing forward the performance-fairness Pareto frontier.
