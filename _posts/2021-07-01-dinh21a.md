title: Coded-InvNet for Resilient Prediction Serving Systems
abstract: Inspired by a new coded computation algorithm for invertible functions,
  we propose Coded-InvNet a new approach to design resilient prediction serving systems
  that can gracefully handle stragglers or node failures. Coded-InvNet leverages recent
  findings in the deep learning literature such as invertible neural networks, Manifold
  Mixup, and domain translation algorithms, identifying interesting research directions
  that span across machine learning and systems. Our experimental results show that
  Coded-InvNet can outperform existing approaches, especially when the compute resource
  overhead is as low as 10%. For instance, without knowing which of the ten workers
  is going to fail, our algorithm can design a backup task so that it can correctly
  recover the missing prediction result with an accuracy of 85.9%, significantly outperforming
  the previous SOTA by 32.5%.
