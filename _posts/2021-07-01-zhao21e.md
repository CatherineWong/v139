title: Expressive 1-Lipschitz Neural Networks for Robust Multiple Graph Learning against
  Adversarial Attacks
abstract: Recent findings have shown multiple graph learning models, such as graph
  classification and graph matching, are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
  i.e. small input perturbations in graph structures and node attributes can cause
  the model failures. Existing defense techniques often defend specific attacks on
  particular multiple graph learning tasks. This paper proposes an attack-agnostic
  graph-adaptive 1-Lipschitz neural network, ERNN, for improving the robustness of
  deep multiple graph learning while achieving remarkable expressive power. A K_l-Lipschitz
  Weibull activation function is designed to enforce the gradient norm as K_l at layer
  l. The nearest matrix orthogonalization and polar decomposition techniques are utilized
  to constraint the weight norm as 1/K_l and make the norm-constrained weight close
  to the original weight. The theoretical analysis is conducted to derive lower and
  upper bounds of feasible K_l under the 1-Lipschitz constraint. The combination of
  norm-constrained weight and activation function leads to the 1-Lipschitz neural
  network for expressive and robust multiple graph learning.
