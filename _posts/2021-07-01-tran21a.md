title: Sparse within Sparse Gaussian Processes using Neighbor Information
abstract: Approximations to Gaussian processes (GPs) based on inducing variables,
  combined with variational inference techniques, enable state-of-the-art sparse approaches
  to infer GPs at scale through mini-batch based learning. In this work, we further
  push the limits of scalability of sparse GPs by allowing large number of inducing
  variables without imposing a special structure on the inducing inputs. In particular,
  we introduce a novel hierarchical prior, which imposes sparsity on the set of inducing
  variables. We treat our model variationally, and we experimentally show considerable
  computational gains compared to standard sparse GPs when sparsity on the inducing
  variables is realized considering the nearest inducing inputs of a random mini-batch
  of the data. We perform an extensive experimental validation that demonstrates the
  effectiveness of our approach compared to the state-of-the-art. Our approach enables
  the possibility to use sparse GPs using a large number of inducing points without
  incurring a prohibitive computational cost.
