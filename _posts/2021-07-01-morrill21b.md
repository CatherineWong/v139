title: Neural Rough Differential Equations for Long Time Series
abstract: 'Neural controlled differential equations (CDEs) are the continuous-time
  analogue of recurrent neural networks, as Neural ODEs are to residual networks,
  and offer a memory-efficient continuous-time way to model functions of potentially
  irregular time series. Existing methods for computing the forward pass of a Neural
  CDE involve embedding the incoming time series into path space, often via interpolation,
  and using evaluations of this path to drive the hidden state. Here, we use rough
  path theory to extend this formulation. Instead of directly embedding into path
  space, we instead represent the input signal over small time intervals through its
  \textit{log-signature}, which are statistics describing how the signal drives a
  CDE. This is the approach for solving \textit{rough differential equations} (RDEs),
  and correspondingly we describe our main contribution as the introduction of Neural
  RDEs. This extension has a purpose: by generalising the Neural CDE approach to a
  broader class of driving signals, we demonstrate particular advantages for tackling
  long time series. In this regime, we demonstrate efficacy on problems of length
  up to 17k observations and observe significant training speed-ups, improvements
  in model performance, and reduced memory requirements compared to existing approaches.'
