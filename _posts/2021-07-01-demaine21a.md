title: 'Multidimensional Scaling: Approximation and Complexity'
abstract: Metric Multidimensional scaling (MDS) is a classical method for generating
  meaningful (non-linear) low-dimensional embeddings of high-dimensional data. MDS
  has a long history in the statistics, machine learning, and graph drawing communities.
  In particular, the Kamada-Kawai force-directed graph drawing method is equivalent
  to MDS and is one of the most popular ways in practice to embed graphs into low
  dimensions. Despite its ubiquity, our theoretical understanding of MDS remains limited
  as its objective function is highly non-convex. In this paper, we prove that minimizing
  the Kamada-Kawai objective is NP-hard and give a provable approximation algorithm
  for optimizing it, which in particular is a PTAS on low-diameter graphs. We supplement
  this result with experiments suggesting possible connections between our greedy
  approximation algorithm and gradient-based methods.
