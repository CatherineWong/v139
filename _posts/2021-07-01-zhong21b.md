title: Towards Distraction-Robust Active Visual Tracking
abstract: In active visual tracking, it is notoriously difficult when distracting
  objects appear, as distractors often mislead the tracker by occluding the target
  or bringing a confusing appearance. To address this issue, we propose a mixed cooperative-competitive
  multi-agent game, where a target and multiple distractors form a collaborative team
  to play against a tracker and make it fail to follow. Through learning in our game,
  diverse distracting behaviors of the distractors naturally emerge, thereby exposing
  the trackerâ€™s weakness, which helps enhance the distraction-robustness of the tracker.
  For effective learning, we then present a bunch of practical methods, including
  a reward function for distractors, a cross-modal teacher-student learning strategy,
  and a recurrent attention mechanism for the tracker. The experimental results show
  that our tracker performs desired distraction-robust active visual tracking and
  can be well generalized to unseen environments. We also show that the multi-agent
  game can be used to adversarially test the robustness of trackers.
