title: E(n) Equivariant Graph Neural Networks
abstract: This paper introduces a new model to learn graph neural networks equivariant
  to rotations, translations, reflections and permutations called E(n)-Equivariant
  Graph Neural Networks (EGNNs). In contrast with existing methods, our work does
  not require computationally expensive higher-order representations in intermediate
  layers while it still achieves competitive or better performance. In addition, whereas
  existing methods are limited to equivariance on 3 dimensional spaces, our model
  is easily scaled to higher-dimensional spaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness
  of our method on dynamical systems modelling, representation learning in graph autoencoders
  and predicting molecular properties.
