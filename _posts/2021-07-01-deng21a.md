title: What Does Rotation Prediction Tell Us about Classifier Accuracy under Varying
  Testing Environments?
abstract: 'Understanding classifier decision under novel environments is central to
  the community, and a common practice is evaluating it on labeled test sets. However,
  in real-world testing, image annotations are difficult and expensive to obtain,
  especially when the test environment is changing. A natural question then arises:
  given a trained classifier, can we evaluate its accuracy on varying unlabeled test
  sets? In this work, we train semantic classification and rotation prediction in
  a multi-task way. On a series of datasets, we report an interesting finding, i.e.,
  the semantic classification accuracy exhibits a strong linear relationship with
  the accuracy of the rotation prediction task (Pearsonâ€™s Correlation r > 0.88). This
  finding allows us to utilize linear regression to estimate classifier performance
  from the accuracy of rotation prediction which can be obtained on the test set through
  the freely generated rotation labels.'
