title: Matrix Completion with Model-free Weighting
abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel method for matrix completion under general
  non-uniform missing structures. By controlling an upper bound of a novel balancing
  error, we construct weights that can actively adjust for the non-uniformity in the
  empirical risk without explicitly modeling the observation probabilities, and can
  be computed efficiently via convex optimization. The recovered matrix based on the
  proposed weighted empirical risk enjoys appealing theoretical guarantees. In particular,
  the proposed method achieves stronger guarantee than existing work in terms of the
  scaling with respect to the observation probabilities, under asymptotically heterogeneous
  missing settings (where entry-wise observation probabilities can be of different
  orders). These settings can be regarded as a better theoretical model of missing
  patterns with highly varying probabilities. We also provide a new minimax lower
  bound under a class of heterogeneous settings. Numerical experiments are also provided
  to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
