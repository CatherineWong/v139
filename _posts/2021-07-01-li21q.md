title: Partially Observed Exchangeable Modeling
abstract: Modeling dependencies among features is fundamental for many machine learning
  tasks. Although there are often multiple related instances that may be leveraged
  to inform conditional dependencies, typical approaches only model conditional dependencies
  over individual instances. In this work, we propose a novel framework, partially
  observed exchangeable modeling (POEx) that takes in a set of related partially observed
  instances and infers the conditional distribution for the unobserved dimensions
  over multiple elements. Our approach jointly models the intra-instance (among features
  in a point) and inter-instance (among multiple points in a set) dependencies in
  data. POEx is a general framework that encompasses many existing tasks such as point
  cloud expansion and few-shot generation, as well as new tasks like few-shot imputation.
  Despite its generality, extensive empirical evaluations show that our model achieves
  state-of-the-art performance across a range of applications.
