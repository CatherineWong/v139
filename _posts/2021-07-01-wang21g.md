title: Self-Tuning for Data-Efficient Deep Learning
abstract: 'Deep learning has made revolutionary advances to diverse applications in
  the presence of large-scale labeled datasets. However, it is prohibitively time-costly
  and labor-expensive to collect sufficient labeled data in most realistic scenarios.
  To mitigate the requirement for labeled data, semi-supervised learning (SSL) focuses
  on simultaneously exploring both labeled and unlabeled data, while transfer learning
  (TL) popularizes a favorable practice of fine-tuning a pre-trained model to the
  target data. A dilemma is thus encountered: Without a decent pre-trained model to
  provide an implicit regularization, SSL through self-training from scratch will
  be easily misled by inaccurate pseudo-labels, especially in large-sized label space;
  Without exploring the intrinsic structure of unlabeled data, TL through fine-tuning
  from limited labeled data is at risk of under-transfer caused by model shift. To
  escape from this dilemma, we present Self-Tuning to enable data-efficient deep learning
  by unifying the exploration of labeled and unlabeled data and the transfer of a
  pre-trained model, as well as a Pseudo Group Contrast (PGC) mechanism to mitigate
  the reliance on pseudo-labels and boost the tolerance to false labels. Self-Tuning
  outperforms its SSL and TL counterparts on five tasks by sharp margins, e.g. it
  doubles the accuracy of fine-tuning on Cars with $15%$ labels.'
