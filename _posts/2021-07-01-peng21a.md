title: 'Homomorphic Sensing: Sparsity and Noise'
abstract: "\\emph{Unlabeled sensing} is a recent problem encompassing many data science
  and engineering applications and typically formulated as solving linear equations
  whose right-hand side vector has undergone an unknown permutation. It was generalized
  to the \\emph{homomorphic sensing} problem by replacing the unknown permutation
  with an unknown linear map from a given finite set of linear maps. In this paper
  we present tighter and simpler conditions for the homomorphic sensing problem to
  admit a unique solution. We show that this solution is locally stable under noise,
  while under a sparsity assumption it remains unique under less demanding conditions.
  Sparsity in the context of unlabeled sensing leads to the problem of \\textit{unlabeled
  compressed sensing}, and a consequence of our general theory is the existence under
  mild conditions of a unique sparsest solution. On the algorithmic level, we solve
  unlabeled compressed sensing by an iterative algorithm validated by synthetic data
  experiments. Finally, under the unifying homomorphic sensing framework we connect
  unlabeled sensing to other important practical problems."
