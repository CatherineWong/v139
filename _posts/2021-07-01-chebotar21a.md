title: 'Actionable Models: Unsupervised Offline Reinforcement Learning of Robotic
  Skills'
abstract: We consider the problem of learning useful robotic skills from previously
  collected offline data without access to manually specified rewards or additional
  online exploration, a setting that is becoming increasingly important for scaling
  robot learning by reusing past robotic data. In particular, we propose the objective
  of learning a functional understanding of the environment by learning to reach any
  goal state in a given dataset. We employ goal-conditioned Q-learning with hindsight
  relabeling and develop several techniques that enable training in a particularly
  challenging offline setting. We find that our method can operate on high-dimensional
  camera images and learn a variety of skills on real robots that generalize to previously
  unseen scenes and objects. We also show that our method can learn to reach long-horizon
  goals across multiple episodes through goal chaining, and learn rich representations
  that can help with downstream tasks through pre-training or auxiliary objectives.
