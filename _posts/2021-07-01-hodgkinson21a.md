title: Multiplicative Noise and Heavy Tails in Stochastic Optimization
abstract: Although stochastic optimization is central to modern machine learning,
  the precise mechanisms underlying its success, and in particular, the precise role
  of the stochasticity, still remain unclear. Modeling stochastic optimization algorithms
  as discrete random recurrence relations, we show that multiplicative noise, as it
  commonly arises due to variance in local rates of convergence, results in heavy-tailed
  stationary behaviour in the parameters. Theoretical results are obtained characterizing
  this for a large class of (non-linear and even non-convex) models and optimizers
  (including momentum, Adam, and stochastic Newton), demonstrating that this phenomenon
  holds generally. We describe dependence on key factors, including step size, batch
  size, and data variability, all of which exhibit similar qualitative behavior to
  recent empirical results on state-of-the-art neural network models. Furthermore,
  we empirically illustrate how multiplicative noise and heavy-tailed structure improve
  capacity for basin hopping and exploration of non-convex loss surfaces, over commonly-considered
  stochastic dynamics with only additive noise and light-tailed structure.
