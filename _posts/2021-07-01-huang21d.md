title: 'STRODE: Stochastic Boundary Ordinary Differential Equation'
abstract: Perception of time from sequentially acquired sensory inputs is rooted in
  everyday behaviors of individual organisms. Yet, most algorithms for time-series
  modeling fail to learn dynamics of random event timings directly from visual or
  audio inputs, requiring timing annotations during training that are usually unavailable
  for real-world applications. For instance, neuroscience perspectives on postdiction
  imply that there exist variable temporal ranges within which the incoming sensory
  inputs can affect the earlier perception, but such temporal ranges are mostly unannotated
  for real applications such as automatic speech recognition (ASR). In this paper,
  we present a probabilistic ordinary differential equation (ODE), called STochastic
  boundaRy ODE (STRODE), that learns both the timings and the dynamics of time series
  data without requiring any timing annotations during training. STRODE allows the
  usage of differential equations to sample from the posterior point processes, efficiently
  and analytically. We further provide theoretical guarantees on the learning of STRODE.
  Our empirical results show that our approach successfully infers event timings of
  time series data. Our method achieves competitive or superior performances compared
  to existing state-of-the-art methods for both synthetic and real-world datasets.
