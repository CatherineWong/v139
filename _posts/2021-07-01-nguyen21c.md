title: Cross-model Back-translated Distillation for Unsupervised Machine Translation
abstract: 'Recent unsupervised machine translation (UMT) systems usually employ three
  main principles: initialization, language modeling and iterative back-translation,
  though they may apply them differently. Crucially, iterative back-translation and
  denoising auto-encoding for language modeling provide data diversity to train the
  UMT systems. However, the gains from these diversification processes has seemed
  to plateau. We introduce a novel component to the standard UMT framework called
  Cross-model Back-translated Distillation (CBD), that is aimed to induce another
  level of data diversification that existing principles lack. CBD is applicable to
  all previous UMT approaches. In our experiments, CBD achieves the state of the art
  in the WMT’14 English-French, WMT’16 English-German and English-Romanian bilingual
  unsupervised translation tasks, with 38.2, 30.1, and 36.3 BLEU respectively. It
  also yields 1.5–3.3 BLEU improvements in IWSLT English-French and English-German
  tasks. Through extensive experimental analyses, we show that CBD is effective because
  it embraces data diversity while other similar variants do not.'
