title: Communication-Efficient Distributed SVD via Local Power Iterations
abstract: We study distributed computing of the truncated singular value decomposition
  (SVD). We develop an algorithm that we call \texttt{LocalPower} for improving communication
  efficiency. Specifically, we uniformly partition the dataset among $m$ nodes and
  alternate between multiple (precisely $p$) local power iterations and one global
  aggregation. In the aggregation, we propose to weight each local eigenvector matrix
  with orthogonal Procrustes transformation (OPT). As a practical surrogate of OPT,
  sign-fixing, which uses a diagonal matrix with $\pm 1$ entries as weights, has better
  computation complexity and stability in experiments. We theoretically show that
  under certain assumptions \texttt{LocalPower} lowers the required number of communications
  by a factor of $p$ to reach a constant accuracy. We also show that the strategy
  of periodically decaying $p$ helps obtain high-precision solutions. We conduct experiments
  to demonstrate the effectiveness of \texttt{LocalPower}.
