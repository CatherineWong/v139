title: More Powerful and General Selective Inference for Stepwise Feature Selection
  using Homotopy Method
abstract: Conditional selective inference (SI) has been actively studied as a new
  statistical inference framework for data-driven hypotheses. The basic idea of conditional
  SI is to make inferences conditional on the selection event characterized by a set
  of linear and/or quadratic inequalities. Conditional SI has been mainly studied
  in the context of feature selection such as stepwise feature selection (SFS). The
  main limitation of the existing conditional SI methods is the loss of power due
  to over-conditioning, which is required for computational tractability. In this
  study, we develop a more powerful and general conditional SI method for SFS using
  the homotopy method which enables us to overcome this limitation. The homotopy-based
  SI is especially effective for more complicated feature selection algorithms. As
  an example, we develop a conditional SI method for forward-backward SFS with AIC-based
  stopping criteria and show that it is not adversely affected by the increased complexity
  of the algorithm. We conduct several experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness
  and efficiency of the proposed method.
