title: Personalized Federated Learning using Hypernetworks
abstract: Personalized federated learning is tasked with training machine learning
  models for multiple clients, each with its own data distribution. The goal is to
  train personalized models collaboratively while accounting for data disparities
  across clients and reducing communication costs. We propose a novel approach to
  this problem using hypernetworks, termed pFedHN for personalized Federated HyperNetworks.
  In this approach, a central hypernetwork model is trained to generate a set of models,
  one model for each client. This architecture provides effective parameter sharing
  across clients while maintaining the capacity to generate unique and diverse personal
  models. Furthermore, since hypernetwork parameters are never transmitted, this approach
  decouples the communication cost from the trainable model size. We test pFedHN empirically
  in several personalized federated learning challenges and find that it outperforms
  previous methods. Finally, since hypernetworks share information across clients,
  we show that pFedHN can generalize better to new clients whose distributions differ
  from any client observed during training.
