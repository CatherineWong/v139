title: 'SigGPDE: Scaling Sparse Gaussian Processes on Sequential Data'
abstract: Making predictions and quantifying their uncertainty when the input data
  is sequential is a fundamental learning challenge, recently attracting increasing
  attention. We develop SigGPDE, a new scalable sparse variational inference framework
  for Gaussian Processes (GPs) on sequential data. Our contribution is twofold. First,
  we construct inducing variables underpinning the sparse approximation so that the
  resulting evidence lower bound (ELBO) does not require any matrix inversion. Second,
  we show that the gradients of the GP signature kernel are solutions of a hyperbolic
  partial differential equation (PDE). This theoretical insight allows us to build
  an efficient back-propagation algorithm to optimize the ELBO. We showcase the significant
  computational gains of SigGPDE compared to existing methods, while achieving state-of-the-art
  performance for classification tasks on large datasets of up to 1 million multivariate
  time series.
