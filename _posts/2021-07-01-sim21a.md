title: Directed Graph Embeddings in Pseudo-Riemannian Manifolds
abstract: 'The inductive biases of graph representation learning algorithms are often
  encoded in the background geometry of their embedding space. In this paper, we show
  that general directed graphs can be effectively represented by an embedding model
  that combines three components: a pseudo-Riemannian metric structure, a non-trivial
  global topology, and a unique likelihood function that explicitly incorporates a
  preferred direction in embedding space. We demonstrate the representational capabilities
  of this method by applying it to the task of link prediction on a series of synthetic
  and real directed graphs from natural language applications and biology. In particular,
  we show that low-dimensional cylindrical Minkowski and anti-de Sitter spacetimes
  can produce equal or better graph representations than curved Riemannian manifolds
  of higher dimensions.'
