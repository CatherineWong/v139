title: Finding k in Latent $k-$ polytope
abstract: The recently introduced Latent $k-$ Polytope($\LkP$) encompasses several
  stochastic Mixed Membership models including Topic Models. The problem of finding
  $k$, the number of extreme points of $\LkP$, is a fundamental challenge and includes
  several important open problems such as determination of number of components in
  Ad-mixtures. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing Interpolative Convex
  Rank(\INR) of a matrix defined as the minimum number of its columns whose convex
  hull is within Hausdorff distance $\varepsilon$ of the convex hull of all columns.
  The first important contribution of this paper is to show that under \emph{standard
  assumptions} $k$ equals the \INR of a \emph{subset smoothed data matrix} defined
  from Data generated from an $\LkP$. The second important contribution of the paper
  is a polynomial time algorithm for finding $k$ under standard assumptions. An immediate
  corollary is the first polynomial time algorithm for finding the \emph{inner dimension}
  in Non-negative matrix factorisation(NMF) with assumptions which are qualitatively
  different than existing ones such as \emph{Separability}. %An immediate corollary
  is the first polynomial time algorithm for finding the \emph{inner dimension} in
  Non-negative matrix factorisation(NMF) with assumptions considerably weaker than
  \emph{Separability}.
