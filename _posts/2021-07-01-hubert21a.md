title: Learning and Planning in Complex Action Spaces
abstract: 'Many important real-world problems have action spaces that are high-dimensional,
  continuous or both, making full enumeration of all possible actions infeasible.
  Instead, only small subsets of actions can be sampled for the purpose of policy
  evaluation and improvement. In this paper, we propose a general framework to reason
  in a principled way about policy evaluation and improvement over such sampled action
  subsets. This sample-based policy iteration framework can in principle be applied
  to any reinforcement learning algorithm based upon policy iteration. Concretely,
  we propose Sampled MuZero, an extension of the MuZero algorithm that is able to
  learn in domains with arbitrarily complex action spaces by planning over sampled
  actions. We demonstrate this approach on the classical board game of Go and on two
  continuous control benchmark domains: DeepMind Control Suite and Real-World RL Suite.'
