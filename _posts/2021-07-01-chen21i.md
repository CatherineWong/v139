title: 'Mandoline: Model Evaluation under Distribution Shift'
abstract: Machine learning models are often deployed in different settings than they
  were trained and validated on, posing a challenge to practitioners who wish to predict
  how well the deployed model will perform on a target distribution. If an unlabeled
  sample from the target distribution is available, along with a labeled sample from
  a possibly different source distribution, standard approaches such as importance
  weighting can be applied to estimate performance on the target. However, importance
  weighting struggles when the source and target distributions have non-overlapping
  support or are high-dimensional. Taking inspiration from fields such as epidemiology
  and polling, we develop Mandoline, a new evaluation framework that mitigates these
  issues. Our key insight is that practitioners may have prior knowledge about the
  ways in which the distribution shifts, which we can use to better guide the importance
  weighting procedure. Specifically, users write simple "slicing functions" {–} noisy,
  potentially correlated binary functions intended to capture possible axes of distribution
  shift {–} to compute reweighted performance estimates. We further describe a density
  ratio estimation framework for the slices and show how its estimation error scales
  with slice quality and dataset size. Empirical validation on NLP and vision tasks
  shows that Mandoline can estimate performance on the target distribution up to 3x
  more accurately compared to standard baselines.
