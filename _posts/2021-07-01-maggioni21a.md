title: Learning Interaction Kernels for Agent Systems on Riemannian Manifolds
abstract: 'Interacting agent and particle systems are extensively used to model complex
  phenomena in science and engineering. We consider the problem of learning interaction
  kernels in these dynamical systems constrained to evolve on Riemannian manifolds
  from given trajectory data. The models we consider are based on interaction kernels
  depending on pairwise Riemannian distances between agents, with agents interacting
  locally along the direction of the shortest geodesic connecting them. We show that
  our estimators converge at a rate that is independent of the dimension of the state
  space, and derive bounds on the trajectory estimation error, on the manifold, between
  the observed and estimated dynamics. We demonstrate the performance of our estimator
  on two classical first order interacting systems: Opinion Dynamics and a Predator-Swarm
  system, with each system constrained on two prototypical manifolds, the $2$-dimensional
  sphere and the Poincar√© disk model of hyperbolic space.'
