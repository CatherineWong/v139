title: 'SinIR: Efficient General Image Manipulation with Single Image Reconstruction'
abstract: We propose SinIR, an efficient reconstruction-based framework trained on
  a single natural image for general image manipulation, including super-resolution,
  editing, harmonization, paint-to-image, photo-realistic style transfer, and artistic
  style transfer. We train our model on a single image with cascaded multi-scale learning,
  where each network at each scale is responsible for image reconstruction. This reconstruction
  objective greatly reduces the complexity and running time of training, compared
  to the GAN objective. However, the reconstruction objective also exacerbates the
  output quality. Therefore, to solve this problem, we further utilize simple random
  pixel shuffling, which also gives control over manipulation, inspired by the Denoising
  Autoencoder. With quantitative evaluation, we show that SinIR has competitive performance
  on various image manipulation tasks. Moreover, with a much simpler training objective
  (i.e., reconstruction), SinIR is trained 33.5 times faster than SinGAN (for 500x500
  images) that solves similar tasks. Our code is publicly available at github.com/YooJiHyeong/SinIR.
