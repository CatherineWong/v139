title: The Power of Adaptivity for Stochastic Submodular Cover
abstract: 'In the stochastic submodular cover problem, the goal is to select a subset
  of stochastic items of minimum expected cost to cover a submodular function. Solutions
  in this setting correspond to a sequential decision process that selects items one
  by one “adaptively” (depending on prior observations). While such adaptive solutions
  achieve the best objective, the inherently sequential nature makes them undesirable
  in many applications. We ask: \emph{how well can solutions with only a few adaptive
  rounds approximate fully-adaptive solutions?} We consider both cases where the stochastic
  items are independent, and where they are correlated. For both situations, we obtain
  nearly tight answers, establishing smooth tradeoffs between the number of adaptive
  rounds and the solution quality, relative to fully adaptive solutions. Experiments
  on synthetic and real datasets validate the practical performance of our algorithms,
  showing qualitative improvements in the solutions as we allow more rounds of adaptivity;
  in practice, solutions using just a few rounds of adaptivity are nearly as good
  as fully adaptive solutions.'
