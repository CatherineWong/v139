title: On the Problem of Underranking in Group-Fair Ranking
abstract: Bias in ranking systems, especially among the top ranks, can worsen social
  and economic inequalities, polarize opinions, and reinforce stereotypes. On the
  other hand, a bias correction for minority groups can cause more harm if perceived
  as favoring group-fair outcomes over meritocracy. Most group-fair ranking algorithms
  post-process a given ranking and output a group-fair ranking. In this paper, we
  formulate the problem of underranking in group-fair rankings based on how close
  the group-fair rank of each item is to its original rank, and prove a lower bound
  on the trade-off achievable for simultaneous underranking and group fairness in
  ranking. We give a fair ranking algorithm that takes any given ranking and outputs
  another ranking with simultaneous underranking and group fairness guarantees comparable
  to the lower bound we prove. Our experimental results confirm the theoretical trade-off
  between underranking and group fairness, and also show that our algorithm achieves
  the best of both when compared to the state-of-the-art baselines.
