title: 'Ditto: Fair and Robust Federated Learning Through Personalization'
abstract: Fairness and robustness are two important concerns for federated learning
  systems. In this work, we identify that robustness to data and model poisoning attacks
  and fairness, measured as the uniformity of performance across devices, are competing
  constraints in statistically heterogeneous networks. To address these constraints,
  we propose employing a simple, general framework for personalized federated learning,
  Ditto, that can inherently provide fairness and robustness benefits, and develop
  a scalable solver for it. Theoretically, we analyze the ability of Ditto to achieve
  fairness and robustness simultaneously on a class of linear problems. Empirically,
  across a suite of federated datasets, we show that Ditto not only achieves competitive
  performance relative to recent personalization methods, but also enables more accurate,
  robust, and fair models relative to state-of-the-art fair or robust baselines.
