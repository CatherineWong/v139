title: On Monotonic Linear Interpolation of Neural Network Parameters
abstract: Linear interpolation between initial neural network parameters and converged
  parameters after training with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) typically leads
  to a monotonic decrease in the training objective. This Monotonic Linear Interpolation
  (MLI) property, first observed by Goodfellow et al. 2014, persists in spite of the
  non-convex objectives and highly non-linear training dynamics of neural networks.
  Extending this work, we evaluate several hypotheses for this property that, to our
  knowledge, have not yet been explored. Using tools from differential geometry, we
  draw connections between the interpolated paths in function space and the monotonicity
  of the network â€” providing sufficient conditions for the MLI property under mean
  squared error. While the MLI property holds under various settings (e.g., network
  architectures and learning problems), we show in practice that networks violating
  the MLI property can be produced systematically, by encouraging the weights to move
  far from initialization. The MLI property raises important questions about the loss
  landscape geometry of neural networks and highlights the need to further study their
  global properties.
