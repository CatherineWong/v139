title: Bias-Variance Reduced Local SGD for Less Heterogeneous Federated Learning
abstract: Recently, local SGD has got much attention and been extensively studied
  in the distributed learning community to overcome the communication bottleneck problem.
  However, the superiority of local SGD to minibatch SGD only holds in quite limited
  situations. In this paper, we study a new local algorithm called Bias-Variance Reduced
  Local SGD (BVR-L-SGD) for nonconvex distributed optimization. Algorithmically, our
  proposed bias and variance reduced local gradient estimator fully utilizes small
  second-order heterogeneity of local objectives and suggests randomly picking up
  one of the local models instead of taking the average of them when workers are synchronized.
  Theoretically, under small heterogeneity of local objectives, we show that BVR-L-SGD
  achieves better communication complexity than both the previous non-local and local
  methods under mild conditions, and particularly BVR-L-SGD is the first method that
  breaks the barrier of communication complexity $\Theta(1/\varepsilon)$ for general
  nonconvex smooth objectives when the heterogeneity is small and the local computation
  budget is large. Numerical results are given to verify the theoretical findings
  and give empirical evidence of the superiority of our method.
