title: Provably Efficient Reinforcement Learning for Discounted MDPs with Feature
  Mapping
abstract: Modern tasks in reinforcement learning have large state and action spaces.
  To deal with them efficiently, one often uses predefined feature mapping to represent
  states and actions in a low dimensional space. In this paper, we study reinforcement
  learning for discounted Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), where the transition kernel
  can be parameterized as a linear function of certain feature mapping. We propose
  a novel algorithm which makes use of the feature mapping and obtains a $\tilde O(d\sqrt{T}/(1-\gamma)^2)$
  regret, where $d$ is the dimension of the feature space, $T$ is the time horizon
  and $\gamma$ is the discount factor of the MDP. To the best of our knowledge, this
  is the first polynomial regret bound without accessing a generative model or making
  strong assumptions such as ergodicity of the MDP. By constructing a special class
  of MDPs, we also show that for any algorithms, the regret is lower bounded by $\Omega(d\sqrt{T}/(1-\gamma)^{1.5})$.
  Our upper and lower bound results together suggest that the proposed reinforcement
  learning algorithm is near-optimal up to a $(1-\gamma)^{-0.5}$ factor.
