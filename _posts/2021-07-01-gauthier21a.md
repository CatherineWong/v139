title: Parametric Graph for Unimodal Ranking Bandit
abstract: We tackle the online ranking problem of assigning $L$ items to $K$ positions
  on a web page in order to maximize the number of user clicks. We propose an original
  algorithm, easy to implement and with strong theoretical guarantees to tackle this
  problem in the Position-Based Model (PBM) setting, well suited for applications
  where items are displayed on a grid. Besides learning to rank, our algorithm, GRAB
  (for parametric Graph for unimodal RAnking Bandit), also learns the parameter of
  a compact graph over permutations of $K$ items among $L$. The logarithmic regret
  bound of this algorithm is a direct consequence of the unimodality property of the
  bandit setting with respect to the learned graph. Experiments against state-of-the-art
  learning algorithms which also tackle the PBM setting, show that our method is more
  efficient while giving regret performance on par with the best known algorithms
  on simulated and real life datasets.
