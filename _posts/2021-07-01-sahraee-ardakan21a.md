title: Asymptotics of Ridge Regression in Convolutional Models
abstract: Understanding generalization and estimation error of estimators for simple
  models such as linear and generalized linear models has attracted a lot of attention
  recently. This is in part due to an interesting observation made in machine learning
  community that highly over-parameterized neural networks achieve zero training error,
  and yet they are able to generalize well over the test samples. This phenomenon
  is captured by the so called double descent curve, where the generalization error
  starts decreasing again after the interpolation threshold. A series of recent works
  tried to explain such phenomenon for simple models. In this work, we analyze the
  asymptotics of estimation error in ridge estimators for convolutional linear models.
  These convolutional inverse problems, also known as deconvolution, naturally arise
  in different fields such as seismology, imaging, and acoustics among others. Our
  results hold for a large class of input distributions that include i.i.d. features
  as a special case. We derive exact formulae for estimation error of ridge estimators
  that hold in a certain high-dimensional regime. We show the double descent phenomenon
  in our experiments for convolutional models and show that our theoretical results
  match the experiments.
