title: 'Latent Programmer: Discrete Latent Codes for Program Synthesis'
abstract: A key problem in program synthesis is searching over the large space of
  possible programs. Human programmers might decide the high-level structure of the
  desired program before thinking about the details; motivated by this intuition,
  we consider two-level search for program synthesis, in which the synthesizer first
  generates a plan, a sequence of symbols that describes the desired program at a
  high level, before generating the program. We propose to learn representations of
  programs that can act as plans to organize such a two-level search. Discrete latent
  codes are appealing for this purpose, and can be learned by applying recent work
  on discrete autoencoders. Based on these insights, we introduce the Latent Programmer
  (LP), a program synthesis method that first predicts a discrete latent code from
  input/output examples, and then generates the program in the target language. We
  evaluate the LP on two domains, demonstrating that it yields an improvement in accuracy,
  especially on longer programs for which search is most difficult.
