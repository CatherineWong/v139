title: 'Amortized Conditional Normalized Maximum Likelihood: Reliable Out of Distribution
  Uncertainty Estimation'
abstract: While deep neural networks provide good performance for a range of challenging
  tasks, calibration and uncertainty estimation remain major challenges, especially
  under distribution shift. In this paper, we propose the amortized conditional normalized
  maximum likelihood (ACNML) method as a scalable general-purpose approach for uncertainty
  estimation, calibration, and out-of-distribution robustness with deep networks.
  Our algorithm builds on the conditional normalized maximum likelihood (CNML) coding
  scheme, which has minimax optimal properties according to the minimum description
  length principle, but is computationally intractable to evaluate exactly for all
  but the simplest of model classes. We propose to use approximate Bayesian inference
  technqiues to produce a tractable approximation to the CNML distribution. Our approach
  can be combined with any approximate inference algorithm that provides tractable
  posterior densities over model parameters. We demonstrate that ACNML compares favorably
  to a number of prior techniques for uncertainty estimation in terms of calibration
  when faced with distribution shift.
