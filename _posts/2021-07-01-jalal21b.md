title: Fairness for Image Generation with Uncertain Sensitive Attributes
abstract: This work tackles the issue of fairness in the context of generative procedures,
  such as image super-resolution, which entail different definitions from the standard
  classification setting. Moreover, while traditional group fairness definitions are
  typically defined with respect to specified protected groups – camouflaging the
  fact that these groupings are artificial and carry historical and political motivations
  – we emphasize that there are no ground truth identities. For instance, should South
  and East Asians be viewed as a single group or separate groups? Should we consider
  one race as a whole or further split by gender? Choosing which groups are valid
  and who belongs in them is an impossible dilemma and being “fair” with respect to
  Asians may require being “unfair” with respect to South Asians. This motivates the
  introduction of definitions that allow algorithms to be \emph{oblivious} to the
  relevant groupings. We define several intuitive notions of group fairness and study
  their incompatibilities and trade-offs. We show that the natural extension of demographic
  parity is strongly dependent on the grouping, and \emph{impossible} to achieve obliviously.
  On the other hand, the conceptually new definition we introduce, Conditional Proportional
  Representation, can be achieved obliviously through Posterior Sampling. Our experiments
  validate our theoretical results and achieve fair image reconstruction using state-of-the-art
  generative models.
