title: Emergent Social Learning via Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning
abstract: 'Social learning is a key component of human and animal intelligence. By
  taking cues from the behavior of experts in their environment, social learners can
  acquire sophisticated behavior and rapidly adapt to new circumstances. This paper
  investigates whether independent reinforcement learning (RL) agents in a multi-agent
  environment can learn to use social learning to improve their performance. We find
  that in most circumstances, vanilla model-free RL agents do not use social learning.
  We analyze the reasons for this deficiency, and show that by imposing constraints
  on the training environment and introducing a model-based auxiliary loss we are
  able to obtain generalized social learning policies which enable agents to: i) discover
  complex skills that are not learned from single-agent training, and ii) adapt online
  to novel environments by taking cues from experts present in the new environment.
  In contrast, agents trained with model-free RL or imitation learning generalize
  poorly and do not succeed in the transfer tasks. By mixing multi-agent and solo
  training, we can obtain agents that use social learning to gain skills that they
  can deploy when alone, even out-performing agents trained alone from the start.'
