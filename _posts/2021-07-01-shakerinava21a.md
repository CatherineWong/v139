title: Equivariant Networks for Pixelized Spheres
abstract: Pixelizations of Platonic solids such as the cube and icosahedron have been
  widely used to represent spherical data, from climate records to Cosmic Microwave
  Background maps. Platonic solids have well-known global symmetries. Once we pixelize
  each face of the solid, each face also possesses its own local symmetries in the
  form of Euclidean isometries. One way to combine these symmetries is through a hierarchy.
  However, this approach does not adequately model the interplay between the two levels
  of symmetry transformations. We show how to model this interplay using ideas from
  group theory, identify the equivariant linear maps, and introduce equivariant padding
  that respects these symmetries. Deep networks that use these maps as their building
  blocks generalize gauge equivariant CNNs on pixelized spheres. These deep networks
  achieve state-of-the-art results on semantic segmentation for climate data and omnidirectional
  image processing. Code is available at https://git.io/JGiZA.
