title: 'From Poincaré Recurrence to Convergence in Imperfect Information Games: Finding
  Equilibrium via Regularization'
abstract: In this paper we investigate the Follow the Regularized Leader dynamics
  in sequential imperfect information games (IIG). We generalize existing results
  of Poincar{é} recurrence from normal-form games to zero-sum two-player imperfect
  information games and other sequential game settings. We then investigate how adapting
  the reward (by adding a regularization term) of the game can give strong convergence
  guarantees in monotone games. We continue by showing how this reward adaptation
  technique can be leveraged to build algorithms that converge exactly to the Nash
  equilibrium. Finally, we show how these insights can be directly used to build state-of-the-art
  model-free algorithms for zero-sum two-player Imperfect Information Games (IIG).
