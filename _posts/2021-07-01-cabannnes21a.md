title: Disambiguation of Weak Supervision leading to Exponential Convergence rates
abstract: Machine learning approached through supervised learning requires expensive
  annotation of data. This motivates weakly supervised learning, where data are annotated
  with incomplete yet discriminative information. In this paper, we focus on partial
  labelling, an instance of weak supervision where, from a given input, we are given
  a set of potential targets. We review a disambiguation principle to recover full
  supervision from weak supervision, and propose an empirical disambiguation algorithm.
  We prove exponential convergence rates of our algorithm under classical learnability
  assumptions, and we illustrate the usefulness of our method on practical examples.
