title: Variational Data Assimilation with a Learned Inverse Observation Operator
abstract: 'Variational data assimilation optimizes for an initial state of a dynamical
  system such that its evolution fits observational data. The physical model can subsequently
  be evolved into the future to make predictions. This principle is a cornerstone
  of large scale forecasting applications such as numerical weather prediction. As
  such, it is implemented in current operational systems of weather forecasting agencies
  across the globe. However, finding a good initial state poses a difficult optimization
  problem in part due to the non-invertible relationship between physical states and
  their corresponding observations. We learn a mapping from observational data to
  physical states and show how it can be used to improve optimizability. We employ
  this mapping in two ways: to better initialize the non-convex optimization problem,
  and to reformulate the objective function in better behaved physics space instead
  of observation space. Our experimental results for the Lorenz96 model and a two-dimensional
  turbulent fluid flow demonstrate that this procedure significantly improves forecast
  quality for chaotic systems.'
