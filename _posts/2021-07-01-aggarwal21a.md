title: Label Inference Attacks from Log-loss Scores
abstract: Log-loss (also known as cross-entropy loss) metric is ubiquitously used
  across machine learning applications to assess the performance of classification
  algorithms. In this paper, we investigate the problem of inferring the labels of
  a dataset from single (or multiple) log-loss score(s), without any other access
  to the dataset. Surprisingly, we show that for any finite number of label classes,
  it is possible to accurately infer the labels of the dataset from the reported log-loss
  score of a single carefully constructed prediction vector if we allow arbitrary
  precision arithmetic. Additionally, we present label inference algorithms (attacks)
  that succeed even under addition of noise to the log-loss scores and under limited
  precision arithmetic. All our algorithms rely on ideas from number theory and combinatorics
  and require no model training. We run experimental simulations on some real datasets
  to demonstrate the ease of running these attacks in practice.
