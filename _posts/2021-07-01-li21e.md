title: Privacy-Preserving Feature Selection with Secure Multiparty Computation
abstract: Existing work on privacy-preserving machine learning with Secure Multiparty
  Computation (MPC) is almost exclusively focused on model training and on inference
  with trained models, thereby overlooking the important data pre-processing stage.
  In this work, we propose the first MPC based protocol for private feature selection
  based on the filter method, which is independent of model training, and can be used
  in combination with any MPC protocol to rank features. We propose an efficient feature
  scoring protocol based on Gini impurity to this end. To demonstrate the feasibility
  of our approach for practical data science, we perform experiments with the proposed
  MPC protocols for feature selection in a commonly used machine-learning-as-a-service
  configuration where computations are outsourced to multiple servers, with semi-honest
  and with malicious adversaries. Regarding effectiveness, we show that secure feature
  selection with the proposed protocols improves the accuracy of classifiers on a
  variety of real-world data sets, without leaking information about the feature values
  or even which features were selected. Regarding efficiency, we document runtimes
  ranging from several seconds to an hour for our protocols to finish, depending on
  the size of the data set and the security settings.
