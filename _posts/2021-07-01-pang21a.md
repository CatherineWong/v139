title: Latent Space Energy-Based Model of Symbol-Vector Coupling for Text Generation
  and Classification
abstract: We propose a latent space energy-based prior model for text generation and
  classification. The model stands on a generator network that generates the text
  sequence based on a continuous latent vector. The energy term of the prior model
  couples a continuous latent vector and a symbolic one-hot vector, so that discrete
  category can be inferred from the observed example based on the continuous latent
  vector. Such a latent space coupling naturally enables incorporation of information
  bottleneck regularization to encourage the continuous latent vector to extract information
  from the observed example that is informative of the underlying category. In our
  learning method, the symbol-vector coupling, the generator network and the inference
  network are learned jointly. Our model can be learned in an unsupervised setting
  where no category labels are provided. It can also be learned in semi-supervised
  setting where category labels are provided for a subset of training examples. Our
  experiments demonstrate that the proposed model learns well-structured and meaningful
  latent space, which (1) guides the generator to generate text with high quality,
  diversity, and interpretability, and (2) effectively classifies text.
