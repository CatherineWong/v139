title: Efficient Message Passing for 0–1 ILPs with Binary Decision Diagrams
abstract: We present a message passing method for 0{–}1 integer linear programs. Our
  algorithm is based on a decomposition of the original problem into subproblems that
  are represented as binary deci- sion diagrams. The resulting Lagrangean dual is
  solved iteratively by a series of efficient block coordinate ascent steps. Our method
  has linear iteration complexity in the size of the decomposi- tion and can be effectively
  parallelized. The char- acteristics of our approach are desirable towards solving
  ever larger problems arising in structured prediction. We present experimental results
  on combinatorial problems from MAP inference for Markov Random Fields, quadratic
  assignment, discrete tomography and cell tracking for develop- mental biology and
  show promising performance.
