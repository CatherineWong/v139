title: Sharper Generalization Bounds for Clustering
abstract: Existing generalization analysis of clustering mainly focuses on specific
  instantiations, such as (kernel) $k$-means, and a unified framework for studying
  clustering performance is still lacking. Besides, the existing excess clustering
  risk bounds are mostly of order $\mathcal{O}(K/\sqrt{n})$ provided that the underlying
  distribution has bounded support, where $n$ is the sample size and $K$ is the cluster
  numbers, or of order $\mathcal{O}(K^2/n)$ under strong assumptions on the underlying
  distribution, where these assumptions are hard to be verified in general. In this
  paper, we propose a unified clustering learning framework and investigate its excess
  risk bounds, obtaining state-of-the-art upper bounds under mild assumptions. Specifically,
  we derive sharper bounds of order $\mathcal{O}(K^2/n)$ under mild assumptions on
  the covering number of the hypothesis spaces, where these assumptions are easy to
  be verified. Moreover, for the hard clustering scheme, such as (kernel) $k$-means,
  if just assume the hypothesis functions to be bounded, we improve the upper bounds
  from the order $\mathcal{O}(K/\sqrt{n})$ to $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{K}/\sqrt{n})$. Furthermore,
  state-of-the-art bounds of faster order $\mathcal{O}(K/n)$ are obtained with the
  covering number assumptions.
