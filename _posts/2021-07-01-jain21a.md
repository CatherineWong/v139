title: 'Robust Density Estimation from Batches: The Best Things in Life are (Nearly)
  Free'
abstract: In many applications data are collected in batches, some potentially biased,
  corrupt, or even adversarial. Learning algorithms for this setting have therefore
  garnered considerable recent attention. In particular, a sequence of works has shown
  that all approximately piecewise polynomial distributions—and in particular all
  Gaussian, Gaussian-mixture, log-concave, low-modal, and monotone-hazard distributions—can
  be learned robustly in polynomial time. However, these results left open the question,
  stated explicitly in \cite{chen2020learning}, about the best possible sample complexity
  of such algorithms. We answer this question, showing that, perhaps surprisingly,
  up to logarithmic factors, the optimal sample complexity is the same as for genuine,
  non-adversarial, data! To establish the result, we reduce robust learning of approximately
  piecewise polynomial distributions to robust learning of the probability of all
  subsets of size at most $k$ of a larger discrete domain, and learn these probabilities
  in optimal sample complexity linear in $k$ regardless of the domain size. In simulations,
  the algorithm runs very quickly and estimates distributions to essentially the accuracy
  achieved when all adversarial batches are removed. The results also imply the first
  polynomial-time sample-optimal algorithm for robust interval-based classification
  based on batched data.
