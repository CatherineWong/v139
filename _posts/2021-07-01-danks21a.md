title: 'BasisDeVAE: Interpretable Simultaneous Dimensionality Reduction and Feature-Level
  Clustering with Derivative-Based Variational Autoencoders'
abstract: The Variational Autoencoder (VAE) performs effective nonlinear dimensionality
  reduction in a variety of problem settings. However, the black-box neural network
  decoder function typically employed limits the ability of the decoder function to
  be constrained and interpreted, making the use of VAEs problematic in settings where
  prior knowledge should be embedded within the decoder. We present DeVAE, a novel
  VAE-based model with a derivative-based forward mapping, allowing for greater control
  over decoder behaviour via specification of the decoder function in derivative space.
  Additionally, we show how DeVAE can be paired with a sparse clustering prior to
  create BasisDeVAE and perform interpretable simultaneous dimensionality reduction
  and feature-level clustering. We demonstrate the performance and scalability of
  the DeVAE and BasisDeVAE models on synthetic and real-world data and present how
  the derivative-based approach allows for expressive yet interpretable forward models
  which respect prior knowledge.
