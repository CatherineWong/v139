title: Alternative Microfoundations for Strategic Classification
abstract: When reasoning about strategic behavior in a machine learning context it
  is tempting to combine standard microfoundations of rational agents with the statistical
  decision theory underlying classification. In this work, we argue that a direct
  combination of these ingredients leads to brittle solution concepts of limited descriptive
  and prescriptive value. First, we show that rational agents with perfect information
  produce discontinuities in the aggregate response to a decision rule that we often
  do not observe empirically. Second, when any positive fraction of agents is not
  perfectly strategic, desirable stable points—where the classifier is optimal for
  the data it entails—no longer exist. Third, optimal decision rules under standard
  microfoundations maximize a measure of negative externality known as social burden
  within a broad class of assumptions about agent behavior. Recognizing these limitations
  we explore alternatives to standard microfoundations for binary classification.
  We describe desiderata that help navigate the space of possible assumptions about
  agent responses, and we then propose the noisy response model. Inspired by smoothed
  analysis and empirical observations, noisy response incorporates imperfection in
  the agent responses, which we show mitigates the limitations of standard microfoundations.
  Our model retains analytical tractability, leads to more robust insights about stable
  points, and imposes a lower social burden at optimality.
