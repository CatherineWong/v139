title: Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning with Imagined Subgoals
abstract: Goal-conditioned reinforcement learning endows an agent with a large variety
  of skills, but it often struggles to solve tasks that require more temporally extended
  reasoning. In this work, we propose to incorporate imagined subgoals into policy
  learning to facilitate learning of complex tasks. Imagined subgoals are predicted
  by a separate high-level policy, which is trained simultaneously with the policy
  and its critic. This high-level policy predicts intermediate states halfway to the
  goal using the value function as a reachability metric. We donâ€™t require the policy
  to reach these subgoals explicitly. Instead, we use them to define a prior policy,
  and incorporate this prior into a KL-constrained policy iteration scheme to speed
  up and regularize learning. Imagined subgoals are used during policy learning, but
  not during test time, where we only apply the learned policy. We evaluate our approach
  on complex robotic navigation and manipulation tasks and show that it outperforms
  existing methods by a large margin.
