title: Improving Molecular Graph Neural Network Explainability with Orthonormalization
  and Induced Sparsity
abstract: 'Rationalizing which parts of a molecule drive the predictions of a molecular
  graph convolutional neural network (GCNN) can be difficult. To help, we propose
  two simple regularization techniques to apply during the training of GCNNs: Batch
  Representation Orthonormalization (BRO) and Gini regularization. BRO, inspired by
  molecular orbital theory, encourages graph convolution operations to generate orthonormal
  node embeddings. Gini regularization is applied to the weights of the output layer
  and constrains the number of dimensions the model can use to make predictions. We
  show that Gini and BRO regularization can improve the accuracy of state-of-the-art
  GCNN attribution methods on artificial benchmark datasets. In a real-world setting,
  we demonstrate that medicinal chemists significantly prefer explanations extracted
  from regularized models. While we only study these regularizers in the context of
  GCNNs, both can be applied to other types of neural networks.'
