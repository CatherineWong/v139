title: Discriminative Complementary-Label Learning with Weighted Loss
abstract: Complementary-label learning (CLL) deals with the weak supervision scenario
  where each training instance is associated with one \emph{complementary} label,
  which specifies the class label that the instance does \emph{not} belong to. Given
  the training instance ${\bm x}$, existing CLL approaches aim at modeling the \emph{generative}
  relationship between the complementary label $\bar y$, i.e. $P(\bar y\mid {\bm x})$,
  and the ground-truth label $y$, i.e. $P(y\mid {\bm x})$. Nonetheless, as the ground-truth
  label is not directly accessible for complementarily labeled training instance,
  strong generative assumptions may not hold for real-world CLL tasks. In this paper,
  we derive a simple and theoretically-sound \emph{discriminative} model towards $P(\bar
  y\mid {\bm x})$, which naturally leads to a risk estimator with estimation error
  bound at $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{n})$ convergence rate. Accordingly, a practical CLL
  approach is proposed by further introducing weighted loss to the empirical risk
  to maximize the predictive gap between potential ground-truth label and complementary
  label. Extensive experiments clearly validate the effectiveness of the proposed
  discriminative complementary-label learning approach.
