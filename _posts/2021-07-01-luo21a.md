title: 'GraphDF: A Discrete Flow Model for Molecular Graph Generation'
abstract: We consider the problem of molecular graph generation using deep models.
  While graphs are discrete, most existing methods use continuous latent variables,
  resulting in inaccurate modeling of discrete graph structures. In this work, we
  propose GraphDF, a novel discrete latent variable model for molecular graph generation
  based on normalizing flow methods. GraphDF uses invertible modulo shift transforms
  to map discrete latent variables to graph nodes and edges. We show that the use
  of discrete latent variables reduces computational costs and eliminates the negative
  effect of dequantization. Comprehensive experimental results show that GraphDF outperforms
  prior methods on random generation, property optimization, and constrained optimization
  tasks.
