title: Modularity in Reinforcement Learning via Algorithmic Independence in Credit
  Assignment
abstract: Many transfer problems require re-using previously optimal decisions for
  solving new tasks, which suggests the need for learning algorithms that can modify
  the mechanisms for choosing certain actions independently of those for choosing
  others. However, there is currently no formalism nor theory for how to achieve this
  kind of modular credit assignment. To answer this question, we define modular credit
  assignment as a constraint on minimizing the algorithmic mutual information among
  feedback signals for different decisions. We introduce what we call the modularity
  criterion for testing whether a learning algorithm satisfies this constraint by
  performing causal analysis on the algorithm itself. We generalize the recently proposed
  societal decision-making framework as a more granular formalism than the Markov
  decision process to prove that for decision sequences that do not contain cycles,
  certain single-step temporal difference action-value methods meet this criterion
  while all policy-gradient methods do not. Empirical evidence suggests that such
  action-value methods are more sample efficient than policy-gradient methods on transfer
  problems that require only sparse changes to a sequence of previously optimal decisions.
