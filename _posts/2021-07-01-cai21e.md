title: 'GraphNorm: A Principled Approach to Accelerating Graph Neural Network Training'
abstract: Normalization is known to help the optimization of deep neural networks.
  Curiously, different architectures require specialized normalization methods. In
  this paper, we study what normalization is effective for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).
  First, we adapt and evaluate the existing methods from other domains to GNNs. Faster
  convergence is achieved with InstanceNorm compared to BatchNorm and LayerNorm. We
  provide an explanation by showing that InstanceNorm serves as a preconditioner for
  GNNs, but such preconditioning effect is weaker with BatchNorm due to the heavy
  batch noise in graph datasets. Second, we show that the shift operation in InstanceNorm
  results in an expressiveness degradation of GNNs for highly regular graphs. We address
  this issue by proposing GraphNorm with a learnable shift. Empirically, GNNs with
  GraphNorm converge faster compared to GNNs using other normalization. GraphNorm
  also improves the generalization of GNNs, achieving better performance on graph
  classification benchmarks.
