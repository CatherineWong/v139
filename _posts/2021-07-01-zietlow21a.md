title: Demystifying Inductive Biases for (Beta-)VAE Based Architectures
abstract: The performance of Beta-Variational-Autoencoders and their variants on learning
  semantically meaningful, disentangled representations is unparalleled. On the other
  hand, there are theoretical arguments suggesting the impossibility of unsupervised
  disentanglement. In this work, we shed light on the inductive bias responsible for
  the success of VAE-based architectures. We show that in classical datasets the structure
  of variance, induced by the generating factors, is conveniently aligned with the
  latent directions fostered by the VAE objective. This builds the pivotal bias on
  which the disentangling abilities of VAEs rely. By small, elaborate perturbations
  of existing datasets, we hide the convenient correlation structure that is easily
  exploited by a variety of architectures. To demonstrate this, we construct modified
  versions of standard datasets in which (i) the generative factors are perfectly
  preserved; (ii) each image undergoes a mild transformation causing a small change
  of variance; (iii) the leading VAE-based disentanglement architectures fail to produce
  disentangled representations whilst the performance of a non-variational method
  remains unchanged.
