title: 'T-SCI: A Two-Stage Conformal Inference Algorithm with Guaranteed Coverage
  for Cox-MLP'
abstract: It is challenging to deal with censored data, where we only have access
  to the incomplete information of survival time instead of its exact value. Fortunately,
  under linear predictor assumption, people can obtain guaranteed coverage for the
  confidence interval of survival time using methods like Cox Regression. However,
  when relaxing the linear assumption with neural networks (e.g., Cox-MLP \citep{katzman2018deepsurv,kvamme2019time}),
  we lose the guaranteed coverage. To recover the guaranteed coverage without linear
  assumption, we propose two algorithms based on conformal inference. In the first
  algorithm \emph{WCCI}, we revisit weighted conformal inference and introduce a new
  non-conformity score based on partial likelihood. We then propose a two-stage algorithm
  \emph{T-SCI}, where we run WCCI in the first stage and apply quantile conformal
  inference to calibrate the results in the second stage. Theoretical analysis shows
  that T-SCI returns guaranteed coverage under milder assumptions than WCCI. We conduct
  extensive experiments on synthetic data and real data using different methods, which
  validate our analysis.
