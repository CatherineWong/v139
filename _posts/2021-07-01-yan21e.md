title: 'CIFS: Improving Adversarial Robustness of CNNs via Channel-wise Importance-based
  Feature Selection'
abstract: We investigate the adversarial robustness of CNNs from the perspective of
  channel-wise activations. By comparing normally trained and adversarially trained
  models, we observe that adversarial training (AT) robustifies CNNs by aligning the
  channel-wise activations of adversarial data with those of their natural counterparts.
  However, the channels that are \textit{negatively-relevant} (NR) to predictions
  are still over-activated when processing adversarial data. Besides, we also observe
  that AT does not result in similar robustness for all classes. For the robust classes,
  channels with larger activation magnitudes are usually more \textit{positively-relevant}
  (PR) to predictions, but this alignment does not hold for the non-robust classes.
  Given these observations, we hypothesize that suppressing NR channels and aligning
  PR ones with their relevances further enhances the robustness of CNNs under AT.
  To examine this hypothesis, we introduce a novel mechanism, \textit{i.e.}, \underline{C}hannel-wise
  \underline{I}mportance-based \underline{F}eature \underline{S}election (CIFS). The
  CIFS manipulates channels’ activations of certain layers by generating non-negative
  multipliers to these channels based on their relevances to predictions. Extensive
  experiments on benchmark datasets including CIFAR10 and SVHN clearly verify the
  hypothesis and CIFS’s effectiveness of robustifying CNNs.
