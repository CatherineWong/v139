title: Learning Self-Modulating Attention in Continuous Time Space with Applications
  to Sequential Recommendation
abstract: 'User interests are usually dynamic in the real world, which poses both
  theoretical and practical challenges for learning accurate preferences from rich
  behavior data. Among existing user behavior modeling solutions, attention networks
  are widely adopted for its effectiveness and relative simplicity. Despite being
  extensively studied, existing attentions still suffer from two limitations: i) conventional
  attentions mainly take into account the spatial correlation between user behaviors,
  regardless the distance between those behaviors in the continuous time space; and
  ii) these attentions mostly provide a dense and undistinguished distribution over
  all past behaviors then attentively encode them into the output latent representations.
  This is however not suitable in practical scenarios where a userâ€™s future actions
  are relevant to a small subset of her/his historical behaviors. In this paper, we
  propose a novel attention network, named \textit{self-modulating attention}, that
  models the complex and non-linearly evolving dynamic user preferences. We empirically
  demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on top-N sequential recommendation tasks,
  and the results on three large-scale real-world datasets show that our model can
  achieve state-of-the-art performance.'
