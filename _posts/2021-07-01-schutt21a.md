title: Equivariant message passing for the prediction of tensorial properties and
  molecular spectra
abstract: Message passing neural networks have become a method of choice for learning
  on graphs, in particular the prediction of chemical properties and the acceleration
  of molecular dynamics studies. While they readily scale to large training data sets,
  previous approaches have proven to be less data efficient than kernel methods. We
  identify limitations of invariant representations as a major reason and extend the
  message passing formulation to rotationally equivariant representations. On this
  basis, we propose the polarizable atom interaction neural network (PaiNN) and improve
  on common molecule benchmarks over previous networks, while reducing model size
  and inference time. We leverage the equivariant atomwise representations obtained
  by PaiNN for the prediction of tensorial properties. Finally, we apply this to the
  simulation of molecular spectra, achieving speedups of 4-5 orders of magnitude compared
  to the electronic structure reference.
