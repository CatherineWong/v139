title: Finding Relevant Information via a Discrete Fourier Expansion
abstract: A fundamental obstacle in learning information from data is the presence
  of nonlinear redundancies and dependencies in it. To address this, we propose a
  Fourier-based approach to extract relevant information in the supervised setting.
  We first develop a novel Fourier expansion for functions of correlated binary random
  variables. This expansion is a generalization of the standard Fourier analysis on
  the Boolean cube beyond product probability spaces. We further extend our Fourier
  analysis to stochastic mappings. As an important application of this analysis, we
  investigate learning with feature subset selection. We reformulate this problem
  in the Fourier domain and introduce a computationally efficient measure for selecting
  features. Bridging the Bayesian error rate with the Fourier coefficients, we demonstrate
  that the Fourier expansion provides a powerful tool to characterize nonlinear dependencies
  in the features-label relation. Via theoretical analysis, we show that our proposed
  measure finds provably asymptotically optimal feature subsets. Lastly, we present
  an algorithm based on our measure and verify our findings via numerical experiments
  on various datasets.
