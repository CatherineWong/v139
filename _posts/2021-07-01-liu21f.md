title: 'Just Train Twice: Improving Group Robustness without Training Group Information'
abstract: Standard training via empirical risk minimization (ERM) can produce models
  that achieve low error on average but high error on minority groups, especially
  in the presence of spurious correlations between the input and label. Prior approaches
  to this problem, like group distributionally robust optimization (group DRO), generally
  require group annotations for every training point. On the other hand, approaches
  that do not use group annotations generally do not improve minority performance.
  For example, we find that joint DRO, which dynamically upweights examples with high
  training loss, tends to optimize for examples that are irrelevant to the specific
  groups we seek to do well on. In this paper, we propose a simple two-stage approach,
  JTT, that achieves comparable performance to group DRO while only requiring group
  annotations on a significantly smaller validation set. JTT first attempts to identify
  informative training examples, which are often minority examples, by training an
  initial ERM classifier and selecting the examples with high training loss. Then,
  it trains a final classifier by upsampling the selected examples. Crucially, unlike
  joint DRO, JTT does not iteratively upsample examples that have high loss under
  the final classifier. On four image classification and natural language processing
  tasks with spurious correlations, we show that JTT closes 85% of the gap in accuracy
  on the worst group between ERM and group DRO.
