title: Efficient Performance Bounds for Primal-Dual Reinforcement Learning from Demonstrations
abstract: "We consider large-scale Markov decision processes with an unknown cost
  function and address the problem of learning a policy from a finite set of expert
  demonstrations. \t\t\tWe assume that the learner is not allowed to interact with
  the expert and has no access to reinforcement signal of any kind. \t\t\tExisting
  inverse reinforcement learning methods come with strong theoretical guarantees,
  but are computationally expensive, while state-of-the-art policy optimization algorithms
  achieve significant empirical success, but are hampered by limited theoretical understanding.
  \t\t\tTo bridge the gap between theory and practice, we introduce a novel bilinear
  saddle-point framework using Lagrangian duality. \t\t\tThe proposed primal-dual
  viewpoint allows us to develop a model-free provably efficient algorithm through
  the lens of stochastic convex optimization. The method enjoys the advantages of
  simplicity of implementation, low memory requirements, and computational and sample
  complexities independent of the number of states. We further present an equivalent
  no-regret online-learning interpretation."
