title: An exact solver for the Weston-Watkins SVM subproblem
abstract: Recent empirical evidence suggests that the Weston-Watkins support vector
  machine is among the best performing multiclass extensions of the binary SVM. Current
  state-of-the-art solvers repeatedly solve a particular subproblem approximately
  using an iterative strategy. In this work, we propose an algorithm that solves the
  subproblem exactly using a novel reparametrization of the Weston-Watkins dual problem.
  For linear WW-SVMs, our solver shows significant speed-up over the state-of-the-art
  solver when the number of classes is large. Our exact subproblem solver also allows
  us to prove linear convergence of the overall solver.
