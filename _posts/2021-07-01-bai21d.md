title: Principled Exploration via Optimistic Bootstrapping and Backward Induction
abstract: One principled approach for provably efficient exploration is incorporating
  the upper confidence bound (UCB) into the value function as a bonus. However, UCB
  is specified to deal with linear and tabular settings and is incompatible with Deep
  Reinforcement Learning (DRL). In this paper, we propose a principled exploration
  method for DRL through Optimistic Bootstrapping and Backward Induction (OB2I). OB2I
  constructs a general-purpose UCB-bonus through non-parametric bootstrap in DRL.
  The UCB-bonus estimates the epistemic uncertainty of state-action pairs for optimistic
  exploration. We build theoretical connections between the proposed UCB-bonus and
  the LSVI-UCB in linear setting. We propagate future uncertainty in a time-consistent
  manner through episodic backward update, which exploits the theoretical advantage
  and empirically improves the sample-efficiency. Our experiments in MNIST maze and
  Atari suit suggest that OB2I outperforms several state-of-the-art exploration approaches.
