title: Model-Free and Model-Based Policy Evaluation when Causality is Uncertain
abstract: When decision-makers can directly intervene, policy evaluation algorithms
  give valid causal estimates. In off-policy evaluation (OPE), there may exist unobserved
  variables that both impact the dynamics and are used by the unknown behavior policy.
  These “confounders” will introduce spurious correlations and naive estimates for
  a new policy will be biased. We develop worst-case bounds to assess sensitivity
  to these unobserved confounders in finite horizons when confounders are drawn iid
  each period. We demonstrate that a model-based approach with robust MDPs gives sharper
  lower bounds by exploiting domain knowledge about the dynamics. Finally, we show
  that when unobserved confounders are persistent over time, OPE is far more difficult
  and existing techniques produce extremely conservative bounds.
