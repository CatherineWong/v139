title: 'Link Prediction with Persistent Homology: An Interactive View'
abstract: Link prediction is an important learning task for graph-structured data.
  In this paper, we propose a novel topological approach to characterize interactions
  between two nodes. Our topological feature, based on the extended persistent homology,
  encodes rich structural information regarding the multi-hop paths connecting nodes.
  Based on this feature, we propose a graph neural network method that outperforms
  state-of-the-arts on different benchmarks. As another contribution, we propose a
  novel algorithm to more efficiently compute the extended persistence diagrams for
  graphs. This algorithm can be generally applied to accelerate many other topological
  methods for graph learning tasks.
