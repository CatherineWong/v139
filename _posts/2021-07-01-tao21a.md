title: 'REPAINT: Knowledge Transfer in Deep Reinforcement Learning'
abstract: Accelerating learning processes for complex tasks by leveraging previously
  learned tasks has been one of the most challenging problems in reinforcement learning,
  especially when the similarity between source and target tasks is low. This work
  proposes REPresentation And INstance Transfer (REPAINT) algorithm for knowledge
  transfer in deep reinforcement learning. REPAINT not only transfers the representation
  of a pre-trained teacher policy in the on-policy learning, but also uses an advantage-based
  experience selection approach to transfer useful samples collected following the
  teacher policy in the off-policy learning. Our experimental results on several benchmark
  tasks show that REPAINT significantly reduces the total training time in generic
  cases of task similarity. In particular, when the source tasks are dissimilar to,
  or sub-tasks of, the target tasks, REPAINT outperforms other baselines in both training-time
  reduction and asymptotic performance of return scores.
