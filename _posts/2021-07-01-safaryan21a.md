title: 'Stochastic Sign Descent Methods: New Algorithms and Better Theory'
abstract: 'Various gradient compression schemes have been proposed to mitigate the
  communication cost in distributed training of large scale machine learning models.
  Sign-based methods, such as signSGD (Bernstein et al., 2018), have recently been
  gaining popularity because of their simple compression rule and connection to adaptive
  gradient methods, like ADAM. In this paper, we analyze sign-based methods for non-convex
  optimization in three key settings: (i) standard single node, (ii) parallel with
  shared data and (iii) distributed with partitioned data. For single machine case,
  we generalize the previous analysis of signSGD relying on intuitive bounds on success
  probabilities and allowing even biased estimators. Furthermore, we extend the analysis
  to parallel setting within a parameter server framework, where exponentially fast
  noise reduction is guaranteed with respect to number of nodes, maintaining $1$-bit
  compression in both directions and using small mini-batch sizes. Next, we identify
  a fundamental issue with signSGD to converge in distributed environment. To resolve
  this issue, we propose a new sign-based method, {\em Stochastic Sign Descent with
  Momentum (SSDM)}, which converges under standard bounded variance assumption with
  the optimal asymptotic rate. We validate several aspects of our theoretical findings
  with numerical experiments.'
