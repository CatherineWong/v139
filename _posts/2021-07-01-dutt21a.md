title: Exponential Reduction in Sample Complexity with Learning of Ising Model Dynamics
abstract: The usual setting for learning the structure and parameters of a graphical
  model assumes the availability of independent samples produced from the corresponding
  multivariate probability distribution. However, for many models the mixing time
  of the respective Markov chain can be very large and i.i.d. samples may not be obtained.
  We study the problem of reconstructing binary graphical models from correlated samples
  produced by a dynamical process, which is natural in many applications. We analyze
  the sample complexity of two estimators that are based on the interaction screening
  objective and the conditional likelihood loss. We observe that for samples coming
  from a dynamical process far from equilibrium, the sample complexity reduces exponentially
  compared to a dynamical process that mixes quickly.
