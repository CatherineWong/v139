title: Exploiting Shared Representations for Personalized Federated Learning
abstract: Deep neural networks have shown the ability to extract universal feature
  representations from data such as images and text that have been useful for a variety
  of learning tasks. However, the fruits of representation learning have yet to be
  fully-realized in federated settings. Although data in federated settings is often
  non-i.i.d. across clients, the success of centralized deep learning suggests that
  data often shares a global {\em feature representation}, while the statistical heterogeneity
  across clients or tasks is concentrated in the {\em labels}. Based on this intuition,
  we propose a novel federated learning framework and algorithm for learning a shared
  data representation across clients and unique local heads for each client. Our algorithm
  harnesses the distributed computational power across clients to perform many local-updates
  with respect to the low-dimensional local parameters for every update of the representation.
  We prove that this method obtains linear convergence to the ground-truth representation
  with near-optimal sample complexity in a linear setting, demonstrating that it can
  efficiently reduce the problem dimension for each client. Further, we provide extensive
  experimental results demonstrating the improvement of our method over alternative
  personalized federated learning approaches in heterogeneous settings.
