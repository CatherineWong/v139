title: 'LEGO: Latent Execution-Guided Reasoning for Multi-Hop Question Answering on
  Knowledge Graphs'
abstract: Answering complex natural language questions on knowledge graphs (KGQA)
  is a challenging task. It requires reasoning with the input natural language questions
  as well as a massive, incomplete heterogeneous KG. Prior methods obtain an abstract
  structured query graph/tree from the input question and traverse the KG for answers
  following the query tree. However, they inherently cannot deal with missing links
  in the KG. Here we present LEGO, a Latent Execution-Guided reasOning framework to
  handle this challenge in KGQA. LEGO works in an iterative way, which alternates
  between (1) a Query Synthesizer, which synthesizes a reasoning action and grows
  the query tree step-by-step, and (2) a Latent Space Executor that executes the reasoning
  action in the latent embedding space to combat against the missing information in
  KG. To learn the synthesizer without step-wise supervision, we design a generic
  latent execution guided bottom-up search procedure to find good execution traces
  efficiently in the vast query space. Experimental results on several KGQA benchmarks
  demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework compared with previous state of the
  art.
