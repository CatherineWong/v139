title: Correlation Clustering in Constant Many Parallel Rounds
abstract: Correlation clustering is a central topic in unsupervised learning, with
  many applications in ML and data mining. In correlation clustering, one receives
  as input a signed graph and the goal is to partition it to minimize the number of
  disagreements. In this work we propose a massively parallel computation (MPC) algorithm
  for this problem that is considerably faster than prior work. In particular, our
  algorithm uses machines with memory sublinear in the number of nodes in the graph
  and returns a constant approximation while running only for a constant number of
  rounds. To the best of our knowledge, our algorithm is the first that can provably
  approximate a clustering problem using only a constant number of MPC rounds in the
  sublinear memory regime. We complement our analysis with an experimental scalability
  evaluation of our techniques.
