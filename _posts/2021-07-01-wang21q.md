title: The Implicit Bias for Adaptive Optimization Algorithms on Homogeneous Neural
  Networks
abstract: Despite their overwhelming capacity to overfit, deep neural networks trained
  by specific optimization algorithms tend to generalize relatively well to unseen
  data. Recently, researchers explained it by investigating the implicit bias of optimization
  algorithms. A remarkable progress is the work (Lyu & Li, 2019), which proves gradient
  descent (GD) maximizes the margin of homogeneous deep neural networks. Except the
  first-order optimization algorithms like GD, adaptive algorithms such as AdaGrad,
  RMSProp and Adam are popular owing to their rapid training process. Mean-while,
  numerous works have provided empirical evidence that adaptive methods may suffer
  from poor generalization performance. However, theoretical explanation for the generalization
  of adaptive optimization algorithms is still lacking. In this paper, we study the
  implicit bias of adaptive optimization algorithms on homogeneous neural networks.
  In particular, we study the convergent direction of parameters when they are optimizing
  the logistic loss. We prove that the convergent direction of Adam and RMSProp is
  the same as GD, while for AdaGrad, the convergent direction depends on the adaptive
  conditioner. Technically, we provide a unified framework to analyze convergent direction
  of adaptive optimization algorithms by constructing novel and nontrivial adaptive
  gradient flow and surrogate margin. The theoretical findings explain the superiority
  on generalization of exponential moving average strategy that is adopted by RMSProp
  and Adam. To the best of knowledge, it is the first work to study the convergent
  direction of adaptive optimizations on non-linear deep neural networks
