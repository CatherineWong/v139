title: Data-driven Prediction of General Hamiltonian Dynamics via Learning Exactly-Symplectic
  Maps
abstract: We consider the learning and prediction of nonlinear time series generated
  by a latent symplectic map. A special case is (not necessarily separable) Hamiltonian
  systems, whose solution flows give such symplectic maps. For this special case,
  both generic approaches based on learning the vector field of the latent ODE and
  specialized approaches based on learning the Hamiltonian that generates the vector
  field exist. Our method, however, is different as it does not rely on the vector
  field nor assume its existence; instead, it directly learns the symplectic evolution
  map in discrete time. Moreover, we do so by representing the symplectic map via
  a generating function, which we approximate by a neural network (hence the name
  GFNN). This way, our approximation of the evolution map is always \emph{exactly}
  symplectic. This additional geometric structure allows the local prediction error
  at each step to accumulate in a controlled fashion, and we will prove, under reasonable
  assumptions, that the global prediction error grows at most \emph{linearly} with
  long prediction time, which significantly improves an otherwise exponential growth.
  In addition, as a map-based and thus purely data-driven method, GFNN avoids two
  additional sources of inaccuracies common in vector-field based approaches, namely
  the error in approximating the vector field by finite difference of the data, and
  the error in numerical integration of the vector field for making predictions. Numerical
  experiments further demonstrate our claims.
