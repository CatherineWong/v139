title: Black-box density function estimation using recursive partitioning
abstract: We present a novel approach to Bayesian inference and general Bayesian computation
  that is defined through a sequential decision loop. Our method defines a recursive
  partitioning of the sample space. It neither relies on gradients nor requires any
  problem-specific tuning, and is asymptotically exact for any density function with
  a bounded domain. The output is an approximation to the whole density function including
  the normalisation constant, via partitions organised in efficient data structures.
  Such approximations may be used for evidence estimation or fast posterior sampling,
  but also as building blocks to treat a larger class of estimation problems. The
  algorithm shows competitive performance to recent state-of-the-art methods on synthetic
  and real-world problems including parameter inference for gravitational-wave physics.
