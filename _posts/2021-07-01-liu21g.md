title: Event Outlier Detection in Continuous Time
abstract: Continuous-time event sequences represent discrete events occurring in continuous
  time. Such sequences arise frequently in real-life. Usually we expect the sequences
  to follow some regular pattern over time. However, sometimes these patterns may
  be interrupted by unexpected absence or occurrences of events. Identification of
  these unexpected cases can be very important as they may point to abnormal situations
  that need human attention. In this work, we study and develop methods for detecting
  outliers in continuous-time event sequences, including unexpected absence and unexpected
  occurrences of events. Since the patterns that event sequences tend to follow may
  change in different contexts, we develop outlier detection methods based on point
  processes that can take context information into account. Our methods are based
  on Bayesian decision theory and hypothesis testing with theoretical guarantees.
  To test the performance of the methods, we conduct experiments on both synthetic
  data and real-world clinical data and show the effectiveness of the proposed methods.
