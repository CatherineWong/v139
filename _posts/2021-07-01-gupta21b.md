title: Distribution-Free Calibration Guarantees for Histogram Binning without Sample
  Splitting
abstract: We prove calibration guarantees for the popular histogram binning (also
  called uniform-mass binning) method of Zadrozny and Elkan (2001). Histogram binning
  has displayed strong practical performance, but theoretical guarantees have only
  been shown for sample split versions that avoid ’double dipping’ the data. We demonstrate
  that the statistical cost of sample splitting is practically significant on a credit
  default dataset. We then prove calibration guarantees for the original method that
  double dips the data, using a certain Markov property of order statistics. Based
  on our results, we make practical recommendations for choosing the number of bins
  in histogram binning. In our illustrative simulations, we propose a new tool for
  assessing calibration—validity plots—which provide more information than an ECE
  estimate.
