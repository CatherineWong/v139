title: Online Limited Memory Neural-Linear Bandits with Likelihood Matching
abstract: We study neural-linear bandits for solving problems where {\em both} exploration
  and representation learning play an important role. Neural-linear bandits harnesses
  the representation power of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and combines it with efficient
  exploration mechanisms by leveraging uncertainty estimation of the model, designed
  for linear contextual bandits on top of the last hidden layer. In order to mitigate
  the problem of representation change during the process, new uncertainty estimations
  are computed using stored data from an unlimited buffer. Nevertheless, when the
  amount of stored data is limited, a phenomenon called catastrophic forgetting emerges.
  To alleviate this, we propose a likelihood matching algorithm that is resilient
  to catastrophic forgetting and is completely online. We applied our algorithm, Limited
  Memory Neural-Linear with Likelihood Matching (NeuralLinear-LiM2) on a variety of
  datasets and observed that our algorithm achieves comparable performance to the
  unlimited memory approach while exhibits resilience to catastrophic forgetting.
