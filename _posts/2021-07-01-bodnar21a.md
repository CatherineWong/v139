title: 'Weisfeiler and Lehman Go Topological: Message Passing Simplicial Networks'
abstract: The pairwise interaction paradigm of graph machine learning has predominantly
  governed the modelling of relational systems. However, graphs alone cannot capture
  the multi-level interactions present in many complex systems and the expressive
  power of such schemes was proven to be limited. To overcome these limitations, we
  propose Message Passing Simplicial Networks (MPSNs), a class of models that perform
  message passing on simplicial complexes (SCs). To theoretically analyse the expressivity
  of our model we introduce a Simplicial Weisfeiler-Lehman (SWL) colouring procedure
  for distinguishing non-isomorphic SCs. We relate the power of SWL to the problem
  of distinguishing non-isomorphic graphs and show that SWL and MPSNs are strictly
  more powerful than the WL test and not less powerful than the 3-WL test. We deepen
  the analysis by comparing our model with traditional graph neural networks (GNNs)
  with ReLU activations in terms of the number of linear regions of the functions
  they can represent. We empirically support our theoretical claims by showing that
  MPSNs can distinguish challenging strongly regular graphs for which GNNs fail and,
  when equipped with orientation equivariant layers, they can improve classification
  accuracy in oriented SCs compared to a GNN baseline.
