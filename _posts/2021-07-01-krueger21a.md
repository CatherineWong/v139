title: Out-of-Distribution Generalization via Risk Extrapolation (REx)
abstract: Distributional shift is one of the major obstacles when transferring machine
  learning prediction systems from the lab to the real world. To tackle this problem,
  we assume that variation across training domains is representative of the variation
  we might encounter at test time, but also that shifts at test time may be more extreme
  in magnitude. In particular, we show that reducing differences in risk across training
  domains can reduce a model’s sensitivity to a wide range of extreme distributional
  shifts, including the challenging setting where the input contains both causal and
  anti-causal elements. We motivate this approach, Risk Extrapolation (REx), as a
  form of robust optimization over a perturbation set of extrapolated domains (MM-REx),
  and propose a penalty on the variance of training risks (V-REx) as a simpler variant.
  We prove that variants of REx can recover the causal mechanisms of the targets,
  while also providing robustness to changes in the input distribution (“covariate
  shift”). By appropriately trading-off robustness to causally induced distributional
  shifts and covariate shift, REx is able to outperform alternative methods such as
  Invariant Risk Minimization in situations where these types of shift co-occur.
