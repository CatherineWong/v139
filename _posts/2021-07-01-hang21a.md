title: A Collective Learning Framework to Boost GNN Expressiveness for Node Classification
abstract: Collective Inference (CI) is a procedure designed to boost weak relational
  classifiers, specially for node classification tasks. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
  are strong classifiers that have been used with great success. Unfortunately, most
  existing practical GNNs are not most-expressive (universal). Thus, it is an open
  question whether one can improve strong relational node classifiers, such as GNNs,
  with CI. In this work, we investigate this question and propose {\em collective
  learning} for GNNs —a general collective classification approach for node representation
  learning that increases their representation power. We show that previous attempts
  to incorporate CI into GNNs fail to boost their expressiveness because they do not
  adapt CI’s Monte Carlo sampling to representation learning. We evaluate our proposed
  framework with a variety of state-of-the-art GNNs. Our experiments show a consistent,
  significant boost in node classification accuracy —regardless of the choice of underlying
  GNN— for inductive node classification in partially-labeled graphs, across five
  real-world network datasets.
