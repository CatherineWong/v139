title: 'DG-LMC: A Turn-key and Scalable Synchronous Distributed MCMC Algorithm via
  Langevin Monte Carlo within Gibbs'
abstract: Performing reliable Bayesian inference on a big data scale is becoming a
  keystone in the modern era of machine learning. A workhorse class of methods to
  achieve this task are Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms and their design
  to handle distributed datasets has been the subject of many works. However, existing
  methods are not completely either reliable or computationally efficient. In this
  paper, we propose to fill this gap in the case where the dataset is partitioned
  and stored on computing nodes within a cluster under a master/slaves architecture.
  We derive a user-friendly centralised distributed MCMC algorithm with provable scaling
  in high-dimensional settings. We illustrate the relevance of the proposed methodology
  on both synthetic and real data experiments.
