title: Deep Learning for Functional Data Analysis with Adaptive Basis Layers
abstract: Despite their widespread success, the application of deep neural networks
  to functional data remains scarce today. The infinite dimensionality of functional
  data means standard learning algorithms can be applied only after appropriate dimension
  reduction, typically achieved via basis expansions. Currently, these bases are chosen
  a priori without the information for the task at hand and thus may not be effective
  for the designated task. We instead propose to adaptively learn these bases in an
  end-to-end fashion. We introduce neural networks that employ a new Basis Layer whose
  hidden units are each basis functions themselves implemented as a micro neural network.
  Our architecture learns to apply parsimonious dimension reduction to functional
  inputs that focuses only on information relevant to the target rather than irrelevant
  variation in the input function. Across numerous classification/regression tasks
  with functional data, our method empirically outperforms other types of neural networks,
  and we prove that our approach is statistically consistent with low generalization
  error.
