title: Adaptive Sampling for Best Policy Identification in Markov Decision Processes
abstract: We investigate the problem of best-policy identification in discounted Markov
  Decision Processes (MDPs) when the learner has access to a generative model. The
  objective is to devise a learning algorithm returning the best policy as early as
  possible. We first derive a problem-specific lower bound of the sample complexity
  satisfied by any learning algorithm. This lower bound corresponds to an optimal
  sample allocation that solves a non-convex program, and hence, is hard to exploit
  in the design of efficient algorithms. We then provide a simple and tight upper
  bound of the sample complexity lower bound, whose corresponding nearly-optimal sample
  allocation becomes explicit. The upper bound depends on specific functionals of
  the MDP such as the sub-optimality gaps and the variance of the next-state value
  function, and thus really captures the hardness of the MDP. Finally, we devise KLB-TS
  (KL Ball Track-and-Stop), an algorithm tracking this nearly-optimal allocation,
  and provide asymptotic guarantees for its sample complexity (both almost surely
  and in expectation). The advantages of KLB-TS against state-of-the-art algorithms
  are discussed and illustrated numerically.
