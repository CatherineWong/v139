title: Incentivized Bandit Learning with Self-Reinforcing User Preferences
abstract: 'In this paper, we investigate a new multi-armed bandit (MAB) online learning
  model that considers real-world phenomena in many recommender systems: (i) the learning
  agent cannot pull the arms by itself and thus has to offer rewards to users to incentivize
  arm-pulling indirectly; and (ii) if users with specific arm preferences are well
  rewarded, they induce a "self-reinforcing" effect in the sense that they will attract
  more users of similar arm preferences. Besides addressing the tradeoff of exploration
  and exploitation, another key feature of this new MAB model is to balance reward
  and incentivizing payment. The goal of the agent is to maximize the total reward
  over a fixed time horizon $T$ with a low total payment. Our contributions in this
  paper are two-fold: (i) We propose a new MAB model with random arm selection that
  considers the relationship of usersâ€™ self-reinforcing preferences and incentives;
  and (ii) We leverage the properties of a multi-color Polya urn with nonlinear feedback
  model to propose two MAB policies termed "At-Least-$n$ Explore-Then-Commit" and
  "UCB-List". We prove that both policies achieve $O(log T)$ expected regret with
  $O(log T)$ expected payment over a time horizon $T$. We conduct numerical simulations
  to demonstrate and verify the performances of these two policies and study their
  robustness under various settings.'
