title: 'DAGs with No Curl: An Efficient DAG Structure Learning Approach'
abstract: 'Recently directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure learning is formulated
  as a constrained continuous optimization problem with continuous acyclicity constraints
  and was solved iteratively through subproblem optimization. To further improve efficiency,
  we propose a novel learning framework to model and learn the weighted adjacency
  matrices in the DAG space directly. Specifically, we first show that the set of
  weighted adjacency matrices of DAGs are equivalent to the set of weighted gradients
  of graph potential functions, and one may perform structure learning by searching
  in this equivalent set of DAGs. To instantiate this idea, we propose a new algorithm,
  DAG-NoCurl, which solves the optimization problem efficiently with a two-step procedure:
  $1)$ first we find an initial non-acyclic solution to the optimization problem,
  and $2)$ then we employ the Hodge decomposition of graphs and learn an acyclic graph
  by projecting the non-acyclic graph to the gradient of a potential function. Experimental
  studies on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method provides comparable accuracy
  but better efficiency than baseline DAG structure learning methods on both linear
  and generalized structural equation models, often by more than one order of magnitude.'
