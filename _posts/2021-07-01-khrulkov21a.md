title: Functional Space Analysis of Local GAN Convergence
abstract: Recent work demonstrated the benefits of studying continuous-time dynamics
  governing the GAN training. However, this dynamics is analyzed in the model parameter
  space, which results in finite-dimensional dynamical systems. We propose a novel
  perspective where we study the local dynamics of adversarial training in the general
  functional space and show how it can be represented as a system of partial differential
  equations. Thus, the convergence properties can be inferred from the eigenvalues
  of the resulting differential operator. We show that these eigenvalues can be efficiently
  estimated from the target dataset before training. Our perspective reveals several
  insights on the practical tricks commonly used to stabilize GANs, such as gradient
  penalty, data augmentation, and advanced integration schemes. As an immediate practical
  benefit, we demonstrate how one can a priori select an optimal data augmentation
  strategy for a particular generation task.
