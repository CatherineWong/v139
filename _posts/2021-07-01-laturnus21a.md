title: 'MorphVAE: Generating Neural Morphologies from 3D-Walks using a Variational
  Autoencoder with Spherical Latent Space'
abstract: 'For the past century, the anatomy of a neuron has been considered one of
  its defining features: The shape of a neuronâ€™s dendrites and axon fundamentally
  determines what other neurons it can connect to. These neurites have been described
  using mathematical tools e.g. in the context of cell type classification, but generative
  models of these structures have only rarely been proposed and are often computationally
  inefficient. Here we propose MorphVAE, a sequence-to-sequence variational autoencoder
  with spherical latent space as a generative model for neural morphologies. The model
  operates on walks within the tree structure of a neuron and can incorporate expert
  annotations on a subset of the data using semi-supervised learning. We develop our
  model on artificially generated toy data and evaluate its performance on dendrites
  of excitatory cells and axons of inhibitory cells of mouse motor cortex (M1) and
  dendrites of retinal ganglion cells. We show that the learned latent feature space
  allows for better cell type discrimination than other commonly used features. By
  sampling new walks from the latent space we can easily construct new morphologies
  with a specified degree of similarity to their reference neuron, providing an efficient
  generative model for neural morphologies.'
