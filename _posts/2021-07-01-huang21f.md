title: Projection Robust Wasserstein Barycenters
abstract: Collecting and aggregating information from several probability measures
  or histograms is a fundamental task in machine learning. One of the popular solution
  methods for this task is to compute the barycenter of the probability measures under
  the Wasserstein metric. However, approximating the Wasserstein barycenter is numerically
  challenging because of the curse of dimensionality. This paper proposes the projection
  robust Wasserstein barycenter (PRWB) that has the potential to mitigate the curse
  of dimensionality, and a relaxed PRWB (RPRWB) model that is computationally more
  tractable. By combining the iterative Bregman projection algorithm and Riemannian
  optimization, we propose two algorithms for computing the RPRWB, which is a max-min
  problem over the Stiefel manifold. The complexity of arithmetic operations of the
  proposed algorithms for obtaining an $\epsilon$-stationary solution is analyzed.
  We incorporate the RPRWB into a discrete distribution clustering algorithm, and
  the numerical results on real text datasets confirm that our RPRWB model helps improve
  the clustering performance significantly.
