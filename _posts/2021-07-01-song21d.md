title: Variance Reduction via Primal-Dual Accelerated Dual Averaging for Nonsmooth
  Convex Finite-Sums
abstract: Structured nonsmooth convex finite-sum optimization appears in many machine
  learning applications, including support vector machines and least absolute deviation.
  For the primal-dual formulation of this problem, we propose a novel algorithm called
  \emph{Variance Reduction via Primal-Dual Accelerated Dual Averaging (\vrpda)}. In
  the nonsmooth and general convex setting, \vrpda has the overall complexity $O(nd\log\min
  \{1/\epsilon, n\} + d/\epsilon )$ in terms of the primal-dual gap, where $n$ denotes
  the number of samples, $d$ the dimension of the primal variables, and $\epsilon$
  the desired accuracy. In the nonsmooth and strongly convex setting, the overall
  complexity of \vrpda becomes $O(nd\log\min\{1/\epsilon, n\} + d/\sqrt{\epsilon})$
  in terms of both the primal-dual gap and the distance between iterate and optimal
  solution. Both these results for \vrpda improve significantly on state-of-the-art
  complexity estimates—which are $O(nd\log \min\{1/\epsilon, n\} + \sqrt{n}d/\epsilon)$
  for the nonsmooth and general convex setting and $O(nd\log \min\{1/\epsilon, n\}
  + \sqrt{n}d/\sqrt{\epsilon})$ for the nonsmooth and strongly convex setting—with
  a simpler and more straightforward algorithm and analysis. Moreover, both complexities
  are better than \emph{lower} bounds for general convex finite-sum optimization,
  because our approach makes use of additional, commonly occurring structure. Numerical
  experiments reveal competitive performance of \vrpda compared to state-of-the-art
  approaches.
