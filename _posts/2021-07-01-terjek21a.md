title: Moreau-Yosida $f$-divergences
abstract: Variational representations of $f$-divergences are central to many machine
  learning algorithms, with Lipschitz constrained variants recently gaining attention.
  Inspired by this, we define the Moreau-Yosida approximation of $f$-divergences with
  respect to the Wasserstein-$1$ metric. The corresponding variational formulas provide
  a generalization of a number of recent results, novel special cases of interest
  and a relaxation of the hard Lipschitz constraint. Additionally, we prove that the
  so-called tight variational representation of $f$-divergences can be to be taken
  over the quotient space of Lipschitz functions, and give a characterization of functions
  achieving the supremum in the variational representation. On the practical side,
  we propose an algorithm to calculate the tight convex conjugate of $f$-divergences
  compatible with automatic differentiation frameworks. As an application of our results,
  we propose the Moreau-Yosida $f$-GAN, providing an implementation of the variational
  formulas for the Kullback-Leibler, reverse Kullback-Leibler, $\chi^2$, reverse $\chi^2$,
  squared Hellinger, Jensen-Shannon, Jeffreys, triangular discrimination and total
  variation divergences as GANs trained on CIFAR-10, leading to competitive results
  and a simple solution to the problem of uniqueness of the optimal critic.
