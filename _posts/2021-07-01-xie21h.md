title: 'Positive-Negative Momentum: Manipulating Stochastic Gradient Noise to Improve
  Generalization'
abstract: 'It is well-known that stochastic gradient noise (SGN) acts as implicit
  regularization for deep learning and is essentially important for both optimization
  and generalization of deep networks. Some works attempted to artificially simulate
  SGN by injecting random noise to improve deep learning. However, it turned out that
  the injected simple random noise cannot work as well as SGN, which is anisotropic
  and parameter-dependent. For simulating SGN at low computational costs and without
  changing the learning rate or batch size, we propose the Positive-Negative Momentum
  (PNM) approach that is a powerful alternative to conventional Momentum in classic
  optimizers. The introduced PNM method maintains two approximate independent momentum
  terms. Then, we can control the magnitude of SGN explicitly by adjusting the momentum
  difference. We theoretically prove the convergence guarantee and the generalization
  advantage of PNM over Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). By incorporating PNM into
  the two conventional optimizers, SGD with Momentum and Adam, our extensive experiments
  empirically verified the significant advantage of the PNM-based variants over the
  corresponding conventional Momentum-based optimizers. Code: \url{https://github.com/zeke-xie/Positive-Negative-Momentum}.'
