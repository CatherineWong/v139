title: Unsupervised Part Representation by Flow Capsules
abstract: Capsule networks aim to parse images into a hierarchy of objects, parts
  and relations. While promising, they remain limited by an inability to learn effective
  low level part descriptions. To address this issue we propose a way to learn primary
  capsule encoders that detect atomic parts from a single image. During training we
  exploit motion as a powerful perceptual cue for part definition, with an expressive
  decoder for part generation within a layered image model with occlusion. Experiments
  demonstrate robust part discovery in the presence of multiple objects, cluttered
  backgrounds, and occlusion. The learned part decoder is shown to infer the underlying
  shape masks, effectively filling in occluded regions of the detected shapes. We
  evaluate FlowCapsules on unsupervised part segmentation and unsupervised image classification.
