title: Dynamic Game Theoretic Neural Optimizer
abstract: The connection between training deep neural networks (DNNs) and optimal
  control theory (OCT) has attracted considerable attention as a principled tool of
  algorithmic design. Despite few attempts being made, they have been limited to architectures
  where the layer propagation resembles a Markovian dynamical system. This casts doubts
  on their flexibility to modern networks that heavily rely on non-Markovian dependencies
  between layers (e.g. skip connections in residual networks). In this work, we propose
  a novel dynamic game perspective by viewing each layer as a player in a dynamic
  game characterized by the DNN itself. Through this lens, different classes of optimizers
  can be seen as matching different types of Nash equilibria, depending on the implicit
  information structure of each (p)layer. The resulting method, called Dynamic Game
  Theoretic Neural Optimizer (DGNOpt), not only generalizes OCT-inspired optimizers
  to richer network class; it also motivates a new training principle by solving a
  multi-player cooperative game. DGNOpt shows convergence improvements over existing
  methods on image classification datasets with residual and inception networks. Our
  work marries strengths from both OCT and game theory, paving ways to new algorithmic
  opportunities from robust optimal control and bandit-based optimization.
