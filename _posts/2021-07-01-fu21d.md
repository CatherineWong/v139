title: 'Auto-NBA: Efficient and Effective Search Over the Joint Space of Networks,
  Bitwidths, and Accelerators'
abstract: 'While maximizing deep neural networks’ (DNNs’) acceleration efficiency
  requires a joint search/design of three different yet highly coupled aspects, including
  the networks, bitwidths, and accelerators, the challenges associated with such a
  joint search have not yet been fully understood and addressed. The key challenges
  include (1) the dilemma of whether to explode the memory consumption due to the
  huge joint space or achieve sub-optimal designs, (2) the discrete nature of the
  accelerator design space that is coupled yet different from that of the networks
  and bitwidths, and (3) the chicken and egg problem associated with network-accelerator
  co-search, i.e., co-search requires operation-wise hardware cost, which is lacking
  during search as the optimal accelerator depending on the whole network is still
  unknown during search. To tackle these daunting challenges towards optimal and fast
  development of DNN accelerators, we propose a framework dubbed Auto-NBA to enable
  jointly searching for the Networks, Bitwidths, and Accelerators, by efficiently
  localizing the optimal design within the huge joint design space for each target
  dataset and acceleration specification. Our Auto-NBA integrates a heterogeneous
  sampling strategy to achieve unbiased search with constant memory consumption, and
  a novel joint-search pipeline equipped with a generic differentiable accelerator
  search engine. Extensive experiments and ablation studies validate that both Auto-NBA
  generated networks and accelerators consistently outperform state-of-the-art designs
  (including co-search/exploration techniques, hardware-aware NAS methods, and DNN
  accelerators), in terms of search time, task accuracy, and accelerator efficiency.
