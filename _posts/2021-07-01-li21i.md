title: Quantization Algorithms for Random Fourier Features
abstract: The method of random projection (RP) is the standard technique for dimensionality
  reduction, approximate near neighbor search, compressed sensing, etc., which provides
  a simple and effective scheme for approximating pairwise inner products and Euclidean
  distances in massive data. Closely related to RP, the method of random Fourier features
  (RFF) has also become popular for approximating the (nonlinear) Gaussian kernel.
  RFF applies a specific nonlinear transformation on the projected data from RP. In
  practice, using the Gaussian kernel often leads to better performance than the linear
  kernel (inner product). After random projections, quantization is an important step
  for efficient data storage, computation and transmission. Quantization for RP has
  been extensively studied in the literature. In this paper, we focus on developing
  quantization algorithms for RFF. The task is in a sense challenging due to the tuning
  parameter $\gamma$ in the Gaussian kernel. For example, the quantizer and the quantized
  data might be tied to each specific Gaussian kernel parameter $\gamma$. Our contribution
  begins with the analysis on the probability distributions of RFF, and an interesting
  discovery that the marginal distribution of RFF is free of the parameter $\gamma$.
  This significantly simplifies the design of the Lloyd-Max (LM) quantization scheme
  for RFF in that there would be only one LM quantizer (regardless of $\gamma$). Detailed
  theoretical analysis is provided on the kernel estimators and approximation error,
  and experiments confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.
