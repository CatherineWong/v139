title: Local Correlation Clustering with Asymmetric Classification Errors
abstract: 'In the Correlation Clustering problem, we are given a complete weighted
  graph $G$ with its edges labeled as “similar" and “dissimilar" by a noisy binary
  classifier. For a clustering $\mathcal{C}$ of graph $G$, a similar edge is in disagreement
  with $\mathcal{C}$, if its endpoints belong to distinct clusters; and a dissimilar
  edge is in disagreement with $\mathcal{C}$ if its endpoints belong to the same cluster.
  The disagreements vector, $\disagree$, is a vector indexed by the vertices of $G$
  such that the $v$-th coordinate $\disagree_v$ equals the weight of all disagreeing
  edges incident on $v$. The goal is to produce a clustering that minimizes the $\ell_p$
  norm of the disagreements vector for $p\geq 1$. We study the $\ell_p$ objective
  in Correlation Clustering under the following assumption: Every similar edge has
  weight in $[\alpha\mathbf{w},\mathbf{w}]$ and every dissimilar edge has weight at
  least $\alpha\mathbf{w}$ (where $\alpha \leq 1$ and $\mathbf{w}>0$ is a scaling
  parameter). We give an $O\left((\nicefrac{1}{\alpha})^{\nicefrac{1}{2}-\nicefrac{1}{2p}}\cdot
  \log\nicefrac{1}{\alpha}\right)$ approximation algorithm for this problem. Furthermore,
  we show an almost matching convex programming integrality gap.'
