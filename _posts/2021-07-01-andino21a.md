title: 'Unitary Branching Programs: Learnability and Lower Bounds'
abstract: Bounded width branching programs are a formalism that can be used to capture
  the notion of non-uniform constant-space computation. In this work, we study a generalized
  version of bounded width branching programs where instructions are defined by unitary
  matrices of bounded dimension. We introduce a new learning framework for these branching
  programs that leverages on a combination of local search techniques with gradient
  descent over Riemannian manifolds. We also show that gapped, read-once branching
  programs of bounded dimension can be learned with a polynomial number of queries
  in the presence of a teacher. Finally, we provide explicit near-quadratic size lower-bounds
  for bounded-dimension unitary branching programs, and exponential size lower-bounds
  for bounded-dimension read-once gapped unitary branching programs. The first lower
  bound is proven using a combination of Neciporukâ€™s lower bound technique with classic
  results from algebraic geometry. The second lower bound is proven within the framework
  of communication complexity theory.
