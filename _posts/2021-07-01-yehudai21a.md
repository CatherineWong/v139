title: From Local Structures to Size Generalization in Graph Neural Networks
abstract: 'Graph neural networks (GNNs) can process graphs of different sizes, but
  their ability to generalize across sizes, specifically from small to large graphs,
  is still not well understood. In this paper, we identify an important type of data
  where generalization from small to large graphs is challenging: graph distributions
  for which the local structure depends on the graph size. This effect occurs in multiple
  important graph learning domains, including social and biological networks. We first
  prove that when there is a difference between the local structures, GNNs are not
  guaranteed to generalize across sizes: there are "bad" global minima that do well
  on small graphs but fail on large graphs. We then study the size-generalization
  problem empirically and demonstrate that when there is a discrepancy in local structure,
  GNNs tend to converge to non-generalizing solutions. Finally, we suggest two approaches
  for improving size generalization, motivated by our findings. Notably, we propose
  a novel Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) task aimed at learning meaningful representations
  of local structures that appear in large graphs. Our SSL task improves classification
  accuracy on several popular datasets.'
