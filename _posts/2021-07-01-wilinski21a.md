title: Prediction-Centric Learning of Independent Cascade Dynamics from Partial Observations
abstract: Spreading processes play an increasingly important role in modeling for
  diffusion networks, information propagation, marketing and opinion setting. We address
  the problem of learning of a spreading model such that the predictions generated
  from this model are accurate and could be subsequently used for the optimization,
  and control of diffusion dynamics. We focus on a challenging setting where full
  observations of the dynamics are not available, and standard approaches such as
  maximum likelihood quickly become intractable for large network instances. We introduce
  a computationally efficient algorithm, based on a scalable dynamic message-passing
  approach, which is able to learn parameters of the effective spreading model given
  only limited information on the activation times of nodes in the network. The popular
  Independent Cascade model is used to illustrate our approach. We show that tractable
  inference from the learned model generates a better prediction of marginal probabilities
  compared to the original model. We develop a systematic procedure for learning a
  mixture of models which further improves the prediction quality.
