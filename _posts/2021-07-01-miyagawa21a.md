title: 'The Power of Log-Sum-Exp: Sequential Density Ratio Matrix Estimation for Speed-Accuracy
  Optimization'
abstract: 'We propose a model for multiclass classification of time series to make
  a prediction as early and as accurate as possible. The matrix sequential probability
  ratio test (MSPRT) is known to be asymptotically optimal for this setting, but contains
  a critical assumption that hinders broad real-world applications; the MSPRT requires
  the underlying probability density. To address this problem, we propose to solve
  density ratio matrix estimation (DRME), a novel type of density ratio estimation
  that consists of estimating matrices of multiple density ratios with constraints
  and thus is more challenging than the conventional density ratio estimation. We
  propose a log-sum-exp-type loss function (LSEL) for solving DRME and prove the following:
  (i) the LSEL provides the true density ratio matrix as the sample size of the training
  set increases (consistency); (ii) it assigns larger gradients to harder classes
  (hard class weighting effect); and (iii) it provides discriminative scores even
  on class-imbalanced datasets (guess-aversion). Our overall architecture for early
  classification, MSPRT-TANDEM, statistically significantly outperforms baseline models
  on four datasets including action recognition, especially in the early stage of
  sequential observations. Our code and datasets are publicly available.'
