title: Exploiting structured data for learning contagious diseases under incomplete
  testing
abstract: 'One of the ways that machine learning algorithms can help control the spread
  of an infectious disease is by building models that predict who is likely to become
  infected making them good candidates for preemptive interventions. In this work
  we ask: can we build reliable infection prediction models when the observed data
  is collected under limited, and biased testing that prioritizes testing symptomatic
  individuals? Our analysis suggests that when the infection is highly transmissible,
  incomplete testing might be sufficient to achieve good out-of-sample prediction
  error. Guided by this insight, we develop an algorithm that predicts infections,
  and show that it outperforms baselines on simulated data. We apply our model to
  data from a large hospital to predict Clostridioides difficile infections; a communicable
  disease that is characterized by both symptomatically infected and asymptomatic
  (i.e., untested) carriers. Using a proxy instead of the unobserved untested-infected
  state, we show that our model outperforms benchmarks in predicting infections.'
