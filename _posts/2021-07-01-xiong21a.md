title: Explore Visual Concept Formation for Image Classification
abstract: Human beings acquire the ability of image classification through visual
  concept learning, in which the process of concept formation involves intertwined
  searches of common properties and concept descriptions. However, in most image classification
  algorithms using deep convolutional neural network (ConvNet), the representation
  space is constructed under the premise that concept descriptions are fixed as one-hot
  codes, which limits the mining of properties and the ability of identifying unseen
  samples. Inspired by this, we propose a learning strategy of visual concept formation
  (LSOVCF) based on the ConvNet, in which the two intertwined parts of concept formation,
  i.e. feature extraction and concept description, are learned together. First, LSOVCF
  takes sample response in the last layer of ConvNet to induct concept description
  being assumed as Gaussian distribution, which is part of the training process. Second,
  the exploration and experience loss is designed for optimization, which adopts experience
  cache pool to speed up convergence. Experiments show that LSOVCF improves the ability
  of identifying unseen samples on cifar10, STL10, flower17 and ImageNet based on
  several backbones, from the classic VGG to the SOTA Ghostnet. The code is available
  at \url{https://github.com/elvintanhust/LSOVCF}.
