title: "SPECTRE: defending against backdoor attacks using robust statistics"
abstract: Modern machine learning increasingly requires training on a large collection
  of data from multiple sources, not all of which can be trusted. A particularly frightening
  scenario is when a small fraction of corrupted data changes the behavior of the
  trained model when triggered by an attacker-specified watermark. Such a compromised
  model will be deployed unnoticed as the model is accurate otherwise. There has been
  promising attempts to use the intermediate representations of such a model to separate
  corrupted examples from clean ones. However, these methods require a significant
  fraction of the data to be corrupted, in order to have strong enough signal for
  detection. We propose a novel defense algorithm using robust covariance estimation
  to amplify the spectral signature of corrupted data. This defense is able to completely
  remove backdoors whenever the benchmark backdoor attacks are successful, even in
  regimes where previous methods have no hope for detecting poisoned examples.
