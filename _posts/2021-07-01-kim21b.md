title: Self-Improved Retrosynthetic Planning
abstract: Retrosynthetic planning is a fundamental problem in chemistry for finding
  a pathway of reactions to synthesize a target molecule. Recently, search algorithms
  have shown promising results for solving this problem by using deep neural networks
  (DNNs) to expand their candidate solutions, i.e., adding new reactions to reaction
  pathways. However, the existing works on this line are suboptimal; the retrosynthetic
  planning problem requires the reaction pathways to be (a) represented by real-world
  reactions and (b) executable using “building block” molecules, yet the DNNs expand
  reaction pathways without fully incorporating such requirements. Motivated by this,
  we propose an end-to-end framework for directly training the DNNs towards generating
  reaction pathways with the desirable properties. Our main idea is based on a self-improving
  procedure that trains the model to imitate successful trajectories found by itself.
  We also propose a novel reaction augmentation scheme based on a forward reaction
  model. Our experiments demonstrate that our scheme significantly improves the success
  rate of solving the retrosynthetic problem from 86.84% to 96.32% while maintaining
  the performance of DNN for predicting valid reactions.
