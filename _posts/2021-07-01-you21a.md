title: Graph Contrastive Learning Automated
abstract: 'Self-supervised learning on graph-structured data has drawn recent interest
  for learning generalizable, transferable and robust representations from unlabeled
  graphs. Among many, graph contrastive learning (GraphCL) has emerged with promising
  representation learning performance. Unfortunately, unlike its counterpart on image
  data, the effectiveness of GraphCL hinges on ad-hoc data augmentations, which have
  to be manually picked per dataset, by either rules of thumb or trial-and-errors,
  owing to the diverse nature of graph data. That significantly limits the more general
  applicability of GraphCL. Aiming to fill in this crucial gap, this paper proposes
  a unified bi-level optimization framework to automatically, adaptively and dynamically
  select data augmentations when performing GraphCL on specific graph data. The general
  framework, dubbed JOint Augmentation Optimization (JOAO), is instantiated as min-max
  optimization. The selections of augmentations made by JOAO are shown to be in general
  aligned with previous "best practices" observed from handcrafted tuning: yet now
  being automated, more flexible and versatile. Moreover, we propose a new augmentation-aware
  projection head mechanism, which will route output features through different projection
  heads corresponding to different augmentations chosen at each training step. Extensive
  experiments demonstrate that JOAO performs on par with or sometimes better than
  the state-of-the-art competitors including GraphCL, on multiple graph datasets of
  various scales and types, yet without resorting to any laborious dataset-specific
  tuning on augmentation selection. We release the code at https://github.com/Shen-Lab/GraphCL_Automated.'
