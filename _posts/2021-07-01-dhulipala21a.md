title: Hierarchical Agglomerative Graph Clustering in Nearly-Linear Time
abstract: We study the widely-used hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) algorithm
  on edge-weighted graphs. We define an algorithmic framework for hierarchical agglomerative
  graph clustering that provides the first efficient $\tilde{O}(m)$ time exact algorithms
  for classic linkage measures, such as complete- and WPGMA-linkage, as well as other
  measures. Furthermore, for average-linkage, arguably the most popular variant of
  HAC, we provide an algorithm that runs in $\tilde{O}(n\sqrt{m})$ time. For this
  variant, this is the first exact algorithm that runs in subquadratic time, as long
  as $m=n^{2-\epsilon}$ for some constant $\epsilon > 0$. We complement this result
  with a simple $\epsilon$-close approximation algorithm for average-linkage in our
  framework that runs in $\tilde{O}(m)$ time. As an application of our algorithms,
  we consider clustering points in a metric space by first using $k$-NN to generate
  a graph from the point set, and then running our algorithms on the resulting weighted
  graph. We validate the performance of our algorithms on publicly available datasets,
  and show that our approach can speed up clustering of point datasets by a factor
  of 20.7–76.5x.
