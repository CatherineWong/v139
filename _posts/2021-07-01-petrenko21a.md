title: 'Megaverse: Simulating Embodied Agents at One Million Experiences per Second'
abstract: We present Megaverse, a new 3D simulation platform for reinforcement learning
  and embodied AI research. The efficient design of our engine enables physics-based
  simulation with high-dimensional egocentric observations at more than 1,000,000
  actions per second on a single 8-GPU node. Megaverse is up to 70x faster than DeepMind
  Lab in fully-shaded 3D scenes with interactive objects. We achieve this high simulation
  performance by leveraging batched simulation, thereby taking full advantage of the
  massive parallelism of modern GPUs. We use Megaverse to build a new benchmark that
  consists of several single-agent and multi-agent tasks covering a variety of cognitive
  challenges. We evaluate model-free RL on this benchmark to provide baselines and
  facilitate future research.
