title: Re-understanding Finite-State Representations of Recurrent Policy Networks
abstract: We introduce an approach for understanding control policies represented
  as recurrent neural networks. Recent work has approached this problem by transforming
  such recurrent policy networks into finite-state machines (FSM) and then analyzing
  the equivalent minimized FSM. While this led to interesting insights, the minimization
  process can obscure a deeper understanding of a machineâ€™s operation by merging states
  that are semantically distinct. To address this issue, we introduce an analysis
  approach that starts with an unminimized FSM and applies more-interpretable reductions
  that preserve the key decision points of the policy. We also contribute an attention
  tool to attain a deeper understanding of the role of observations in the decisions.
  Our case studies on 7 Atari games and 3 control benchmarks demonstrate that the
  approach can reveal insights that have not been previously noticed.
