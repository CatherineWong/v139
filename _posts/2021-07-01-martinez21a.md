title: Blind Pareto Fairness and Subgroup Robustness
abstract: Much of the work in the field of group fairness addresses disparities between
  predefined groups based on protected features such as gender, age, and race, which
  need to be available at train, and often also at test, time. These approaches are
  static and retrospective, since algorithms designed to protect groups identified
  a priori cannot anticipate and protect the needs of different at-risk groups in
  the future. In this work we analyze the space of solutions for worst-case fairness
  beyond demographics, and propose Blind Pareto Fairness (BPF), a method that leverages
  no-regret dynamics to recover a fair minimax classifier that reduces worst-case
  risk of any potential subgroup of sufficient size, and guarantees that the remaining
  population receives the best possible level of service. BPF addresses fairness beyond
  demographics, that is, it does not rely on predefined notions of at-risk groups,
  neither at train nor at test time. Our experimental results show that the proposed
  framework improves worst-case risk in multiple standard datasets, while simultaneously
  providing better levels of service for the remaining population. The code is available
