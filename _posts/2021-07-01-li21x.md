title: Asymptotic Normality and Confidence Intervals for Prediction Risk of the Min-Norm
  Least Squares Estimator
abstract: This paper quantifies the uncertainty of prediction risk for the min-norm
  least squares estimator in high-dimensional linear regression models. We establish
  the asymptotic normality of prediction risk when both the sample size and the number
  of features tend to infinity. Based on the newly established central limit theorems(CLTs),
  we derive the confidence intervals of the prediction risk under various scenarios.
  Our results demonstrate the sample-wise non-monotonicity of the prediction risk
  and confirm â€œmore data hurt" phenomenon. Furthermore, the width of confidence intervals
  indicates that over-parameterization would enlarge the randomness of prediction
  performance.
