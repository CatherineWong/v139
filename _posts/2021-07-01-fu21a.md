title: 'Learn-to-Share: A Hardware-friendly Transfer Learning Framework Exploiting
  Computation and Parameter Sharing'
abstract: Task-specific fine-tuning on pre-trained transformers has achieved performance
  breakthroughs in multiple NLP tasks. Yet, as both computation and parameter size
  grows linearly with the number of sub-tasks, it is increasingly difficult to adopt
  such methods to the real world due to unrealistic memory and computation overhead
  on computing devices. Previous works on fine-tuning focus on reducing the growing
  parameter size to save storage cost by parameter sharing. However, compared to storage,
  the constraint of computation is a more critical issue with the fine-tuning models
  in modern computing environments. In this work, we propose LeTS, a framework that
  leverages both computation and parameter sharing across multiple tasks. Compared
  to traditional fine-tuning, LeTS proposes a novel neural architecture that contains
  a fixed pre-trained transformer model, plus learnable additive components for sub-tasks.
  The learnable components reuse the intermediate activations in the fixed pre-trained
  model, decoupling computation dependency. Differentiable neural architecture search
  is used to determine a task-specific computation sharing scheme, and a novel early
  stage pruning is applied to additive components for sparsity to achieve parameter
  sharing. Extensive experiments show that with 1.4% of extra parameters per task,
  LeTS reduces the computation by 49.5% on GLUE benchmarks with only 0.2% accuracy
  loss compared to full fine-tuning.
