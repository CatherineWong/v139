title: Quantile Bandits for Best Arms Identification
abstract: We consider a variant of the best arm identification task in stochastic
  multi-armed bandits. Motivated by risk-averse decision-making problems, our goal
  is to identify a set of $m$ arms with the highest $\tau$-quantile values within
  a fixed budget. We prove asymmetric two-sided concentration inequalities for order
  statistics and quantiles of random variables that have non-decreasing hazard rate,
  which may be of independent interest. With these inequalities, we analyse a quantile
  version of Successive Accepts and Rejects (Q-SAR). We derive an upper bound for
  the probability of arm misidentification, the first justification of a quantile
  based algorithm for fixed budget multiple best arms identification. We show illustrative
  experiments for best arm identification.
