title: Uncertainty Weighted Actor-Critic for Offline Reinforcement Learning
abstract: Offline Reinforcement Learning promises to learn effective policies from
  previously-collected, static datasets without the need for exploration. However,
  existing Q-learning and actor-critic based off-policy RL algorithms fail when bootstrapping
  from out-of-distribution (OOD) actions or states. We hypothesize that a key missing
  ingredient from the existing methods is a proper treatment of uncertainty in the
  offline setting. We propose Uncertainty Weighted Actor-Critic (UWAC), an algorithm
  that detects OOD state-action pairs and down-weights their contribution in the training
  objectives accordingly. Implementation-wise, we adopt a practical and effective
  dropout-based uncertainty estimation method that introduces very little overhead
  over existing RL algorithms. Empirically, we observe that UWAC substantially improves
  model stability during training. In addition, UWAC out-performs existing offline
  RL methods on a variety of competitive tasks, and achieves significant performance
  gains over the state-of-the-art baseline on datasets with sparse demonstrations
  collected from human experts.
