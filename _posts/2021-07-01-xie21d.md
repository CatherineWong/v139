title: Batch Value-function Approximation with Only Realizability
abstract: 'We make progress in a long-standing problem of batch reinforcement learning
  (RL): learning Q* from an exploratory and polynomial-sized dataset, using a realizable
  and otherwise arbitrary function class. In fact, all existing algorithms demand
  function-approximation assumptions stronger than realizability, and the mounting
  negative evidence has led to a conjecture that sample-efficient learning is impossible
  in this setting (Chen & Jiang, 2019). Our algorithm, BVFT, breaks the hardness conjecture
  (albeit under a stronger notion of exploratory data) via a tournament procedure
  that reduces the learning problem to pairwise comparison, and solves the latter
  with the help of a state-action-space partition constructed from the compared functions.
  We also discuss how BVFT can be applied to model selection among other extensions
  and open problems.'
