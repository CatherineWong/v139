title: The Distributed Discrete Gaussian Mechanism for Federated Learning with Secure
  Aggregation
abstract: We consider training models on private data that are distributed across
  user devices. To ensure privacy, we add on-device noise and use secure aggregation
  so that only the noisy sum is revealed to the server. We present a comprehensive
  end-to-end system, which appropriately discretizes the data and adds discrete Gaussian
  noise before performing secure aggregation. We provide a novel privacy analysis
  for sums of discrete Gaussians and carefully analyze the effects of data quantization
  and modular summation arithmetic. Our theoretical guarantees highlight the complex
  tension between communication, privacy, and accuracy. Our extensive experimental
  results demonstrate that our solution is essentially able to match the accuracy
  to central differential privacy with less than 16 bits of precision per value.
