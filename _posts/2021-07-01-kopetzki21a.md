title: 'Evaluating Robustness of Predictive Uncertainty Estimation: Are Dirichlet-based
  Models Reliable?'
abstract: 'Dirichlet-based uncertainty (DBU) models are a recent and promising class
  of uncertainty-aware models. DBU models predict the parameters of a Dirichlet distribution
  to provide fast, high-quality uncertainty estimates alongside with class predictions.
  In this work, we present the first large-scale, in-depth study of the robustness
  of DBU models under adversarial attacks. Our results suggest that uncertainty estimates
  of DBU models are not robust w.r.t. three important tasks: (1) indicating correctly
  and wrongly classified samples; (2) detecting adversarial examples; and (3) distinguishing
  between in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Additionally, we
  explore the first approaches to make DBU mod- els more robust. While adversarial
  training has a minor effect, our median smoothing based ap- proach significantly
  increases robustness of DBU models.'
