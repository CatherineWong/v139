title: 'Decision-Making Under Selective Labels: Optimal Finite-Domain Policies and
  Beyond'
abstract: Selective labels are a common feature of high-stakes decision-making applications,
  referring to the lack of observed outcomes under one of the possible decisions.
  This paper studies the learning of decision policies in the face of selective labels,
  in an online setting that balances learning costs against future utility. In the
  homogeneous case in which individualsâ€™ features are disregarded, the optimal decision
  policy is shown to be a threshold policy. The threshold becomes more stringent as
  more labels are collected; the rate at which this occurs is characterized. In the
  case of features drawn from a finite domain, the optimal policy consists of multiple
  homogeneous policies in parallel. For the general infinite-domain case, the homogeneous
  policy is extended by using a probabilistic classifier and bootstrapping to provide
  its inputs. In experiments on synthetic and real data, the proposed policies achieve
  consistently superior utility with no parameter tuning in the finite-domain case
  and lower parameter sensitivity in the general case.
