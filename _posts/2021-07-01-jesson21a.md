title: Quantifying Ignorance in Individual-Level Causal-Effect Estimates under Hidden
  Confounding
abstract: We study the problem of learning conditional average treatment effects (CATE)
  from high-dimensional, observational data with unobserved confounders. Unobserved
  confounders introduce ignorance—a level of unidentifiability—about an individual’s
  response to treatment by inducing bias in CATE estimates. We present a new parametric
  interval estimator suited for high-dimensional data, that estimates a range of possible
  CATE values when given a predefined bound on the level of hidden confounding. Further,
  previous interval estimators do not account for ignorance about the CATE associated
  with samples that may be underrepresented in the original study, or samples that
  violate the overlap assumption. Our interval estimator also incorporates model uncertainty
  so that practitioners can be made aware of such out-of-distribution data. We prove
  that our estimator converges to tight bounds on CATE when there may be unobserved
  confounding and assess it using semi-synthetic, high-dimensional datasets.
