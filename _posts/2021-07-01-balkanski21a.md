title: Instance Specific Approximations for Submodular Maximization
abstract: The predominant measure for the performance of an algorithm is its worst-case
  approximation guarantee. While worst-case approximations give desirable robustness
  guarantees, they can differ significantly from the performance of an algorithm in
  practice. For the problem of monotone submodular maximization under a cardinality
  constraint, the greedy algorithm is known to obtain a 1-1/e approximation guarantee,
  which is optimal for a polynomial-time algorithm. However, very little is known
  about the approximation achieved by greedy and other submodular maximization algorithms
  on real instances. We develop an algorithm that gives an instance-specific approximation
  for any solution of an instance of monotone submodular maximization under a cardinality
  constraint. This algorithm uses a novel dual approach to submodular maximization.
  In particular, it relies on the construction of a lower bound to the dual objective
  that can also be exactly minimized. We use this algorithm to show that on a wide
  variety of real-world datasets and objectives, greedy and other algorithms find
  solutions that approximate the optimal solution significantly better than the 1-1/e
  Â  0.63 worst-case approximation guarantee, often exceeding 0.9.
