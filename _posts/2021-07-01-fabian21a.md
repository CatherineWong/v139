title: Data augmentation for deep learning based accelerated MRI reconstruction with
  limited data
abstract: Deep neural networks have emerged as very successful tools for image restoration
  and reconstruction tasks. These networks are often trained end-to-end to directly
  reconstruct an image from a noisy or corrupted measurement of that image. To achieve
  state-of-the-art performance, training on large and diverse sets of images is considered
  critical. However, it is often difficult and/or expensive to collect large amounts
  of training images. Inspired by the success of Data Augmentation (DA) for classification
  problems, in this paper, we propose a pipeline for data augmentation for accelerated
  MRI reconstruction and study its effectiveness at reducing the required training
  data in a variety of settings. Our DA pipeline, MRAugment, is specifically designed
  to utilize the invariances present in medical imaging measurements as naive DA strategies
  that neglect the physics of the problem fail. Through extensive studies on multiple
  datasets we demonstrate that in the low-data regime DA prevents overfitting and
  can match or even surpass the state of the art while using significantly fewer training
  data, whereas in the high-data regime it has diminishing returns. Furthermore, our
  findings show that DA improves the robustness of the model against various shifts
  in the test distribution.
