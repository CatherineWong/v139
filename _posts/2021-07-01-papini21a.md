title: Leveraging Good Representations in Linear Contextual Bandits
abstract: The linear contextual bandit literature is mostly focused on the design
  of efficient learning algorithms for a given representation. However, a contextual
  bandit problem may admit multiple linear representations, each one with different
  characteristics that directly impact the regret of the learning algorithm. In particular,
  recent works showed that there exist “good” representations for which constant problem-dependent
  regret can be achieved. In this paper, we first provide a systematic analysis of
  the different definitions of “good” representations proposed in the literature.
  We then propose a novel selection algorithm able to adapt to the best representation
  in a set of $M$ candidates. We show that the regret is indeed never worse than the
  regret obtained by running \textsc{LinUCB} on best representation (up to a $\ln
  M$ factor). As a result, our algorithm achieves constant regret if a “good” representation
  is available in the set. Furthermore, we show the algorithm may still achieve constant
  regret by implicitly constructing a “good” representation, even when none of the
  initial representations is “good”. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings
  in a number of standard contextual bandit problems.
