title: Non-Autoregressive Electron Redistribution Modeling for Reaction Prediction
abstract: Reliably predicting the products of chemical reactions presents a fundamental
  challenge in synthetic chemistry. Existing machine learning approaches typically
  produce a reaction product by sequentially forming its subparts or intermediate
  molecules. Such autoregressive methods, however, not only require a pre-defined
  order for the incremental construction but preclude the use of parallel decoding
  for efficient computation. To address these issues, we devise a non-autoregressive
  learning paradigm that predicts reaction in one shot. Leveraging the fact that chemical
  reactions can be described as a redistribution of electrons in molecules, we formulate
  a reaction as an arbitrary electron flow and predict it with a novel multi-pointer
  decoding network. Experiments on the USPTO-MIT dataset show that our approach has
  established a new state-of-the-art top-1 accuracy and achieves at least 27 times
  inference speedup over the state-of-the-art methods. Also, our predictions are easier
  for chemists to interpret owing to predicting the electron flows.
