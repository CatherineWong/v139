title: 'Poisson-Randomised DirBN: Large Mutation is Needed in Dirichlet Belief Networks'
abstract: The Dirichlet Belief NetworkÂ (DirBN) was recently proposed as a promising
  deep generative model to learn interpretable deep latent distributions for objects.
  However, its current representation capability is limited since its latent distributions
  across different layers is prone to form similar patterns and can thus hardly use
  multi-layer structure to form flexible distributions. In this work, we propose Poisson-randomised
  Dirichlet Belief Networks (Pois-DirBN), which allows large mutations for the latent
  distributions across layers to enlarge the representation capability. Based on our
  key idea of inserting Poisson random variables in the layer-wise connection, Pois-DirBN
  first introduces a component-wise propagation mechanism to enable latent distributions
  to have large variations across different layers. Then, we develop a layer-wise
  Gibbs sampling algorithm to infer the latent distributions, leading to a larger
  number of effective layers compared to DirBN. In addition, we integrate out latent
  distributions and form a multi-stochastic deep integer network, which provides an
  alternative view on Pois-DirBN. We apply Pois-DirBN to relational modelling and
  validate its effectiveness through improved link prediction performance and more
  interpretable latent distribution visualisations. The code can be downloaded at
