title: Streaming and Distributed Algorithms for Robust Column Subset Selection
abstract: We give the first single-pass streaming algorithm for Column Subset Selection
  with respect to the entrywise $\ell_p$-norm with $1 \leq p < 2$. We study the $\ell_p$
  norm loss since it is often considered more robust to noise than the standard Frobenius
  norm. Given an input matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times n}$ ($n \gg d$), our algorithm
  achieves a multiplicative $k^{\frac{1}{p} - \frac{1}{2}}\poly(\log nd)$-approximation
  to the error with respect to the \textit{best possible column subset} of size $k$.
  Furthermore, the space complexity of the streaming algorithm is optimal up to a
  logarithmic factor. Our streaming algorithm also extends naturally to a 1-round
  distributed protocol with nearly optimal communication cost. A key ingredient in
  our algorithms is a reduction to column subset selection in the $\ell_{p,2}$-norm,
  which corresponds to the $p$-norm of the vector of Euclidean norms of each of the
  columns of $A$. This enables us to leverage strong coreset constructions for the
  Euclidean norm, which previously had not been applied in this context. We also give
  the first provable guarantees for greedy column subset selection in the $\ell_{1,
  2}$ norm, which can be used as an alternative, practical subroutine in our algorithms.
  Finally, we show that our algorithms give significant practical advantages on real-world
  data analysis tasks.
