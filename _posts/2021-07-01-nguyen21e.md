title: Interactive Learning from Activity Description
abstract: 'We present a novel interactive learning protocol that enables training
  request-fulfilling agents by verbally describing their activities. Unlike imitation
  learning (IL), our protocol allows the teaching agent to provide feedback in a language
  that is most appropriate for them. Compared with reward in reinforcement learning
  (RL), the description feedback is richer and allows for improved sample complexity.
  We develop a probabilistic framework and an algorithm that practically implements
  our protocol. Empirical results in two challenging request-fulfilling problems demonstrate
  the strengths of our approach: compared with RL baselines, it is more sample-efficient;
  compared with IL baselines, it achieves competitive success rates without requiring
  the teaching agent to be able to demonstrate the desired behavior using the learning
  agentâ€™s actions. Apart from empirical evaluation, we also provide theoretical guarantees
  for our algorithm under certain assumptions about the teacher and the environment.'
