title: Unifying Vision-and-Language Tasks via Text Generation
abstract: 'Existing methods for vision-and-language learning typically require designing
  task-specific architectures and objectives for each task. For example, a multi-label
  answer classifier for visual question answering, a region scorer for referring expression
  comprehension, and a language decoder for image captioning, etc. To alleviate these
  hassles, in this work, we propose a unified framework that learns different tasks
  in a single architecture with the same language modeling objective, i.e., multimodal
  conditional text generation, where our models learn to generate labels in text based
  on the visual and textual inputs. On 7 popular vision-and-language benchmarks, including
  visual question answering, referring expression comprehension, visual commonsense
  reasoning, most of which have been previously modeled as discriminative tasks, our
  generative approach (with a single unified architecture) reaches comparable performance
  to recent task-specific state-of-the-art vision-and-language models. Moreover, our
  generative approach shows better generalization ability on questions that have rare
  answers. Also, we show that our framework allows multi-task learning in a single
  architecture with a single set of parameters, achieving similar performance to separately
  optimized single-task models. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/j-min/VL-T5'
