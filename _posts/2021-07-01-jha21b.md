title: Factor-analytic inverse regression for high-dimension, small-sample dimensionality
  reduction
abstract: Sufficient dimension reduction (SDR) methods are a family of supervised
  methods for dimensionality reduction that seek to reduce dimensionality while preserving
  information about a target variable of interest. However, existing SDR methods typically
  require more observations than the number of dimensions ($N > p$). To overcome this
  limitation, we propose Class-conditional Factor Analytic Dimensions (CFAD), a model-based
  dimensionality reduction method for high-dimensional, small-sample data. We show
  that CFAD substantially outperforms existing SDR methods in the small-sample regime,
  and can be extended to incorporate prior information such as smoothness in the projection
  axes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CFAD with an application to functional
  magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measurements during visual object recognition
  and working memory tasks, where it outperforms existing SDR and a variety of other
  dimensionality-reduction methods.
