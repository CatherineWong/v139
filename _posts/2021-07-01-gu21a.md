title: Crystallization Learning with the Delaunay Triangulation
abstract: Based on the Delaunay triangulation, we propose the crystallization learning
  to estimate the conditional expectation function in the framework of nonparametric
  regression. By conducting the crystallization search for the Delaunay simplices
  closest to the target point in a hierarchical way, the crystallization learning
  estimates the conditional expectation of the response by fitting a local linear
  model to the data points of the constructed Delaunay simplices. Instead of conducting
  the Delaunay triangulation for the entire feature space which would encounter enormous
  computational difficulty, our approach focuses only on the neighborhood of the target
  point and thus greatly expedites the estimation for high-dimensional cases. Because
  the volumes of Delaunay simplices are adaptive to the density of feature data points,
  our method selects neighbor data points uniformly in all directions and thus is
  more robust to the local geometric structure of the data than existing nonparametric
  regression methods. We develop the asymptotic properties of the crystallization
  learning and conduct numerical experiments on both synthetic and real data to demonstrate
  the advantages of our method in estimation of the conditional expectation function
  and prediction of the response.
