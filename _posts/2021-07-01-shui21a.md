title: Aggregating From Multiple Target-Shifted Sources
abstract: 'Multi-source domain adaptation aims at leveraging the knowledge from multiple
  tasks for predicting a related target domain. Hence, a crucial aspect is to properly
  combine different sources based on their relations. In this paper, we analyzed the
  problem for aggregating source domains with different label distributions, where
  most recent source selection approaches fail. Our proposed algorithm differs from
  previous approaches in two key ways: the model aggregates multiple sources mainly
  through the similarity of semantic conditional distribution rather than marginal
  distribution; the model proposes a unified framework to select relevant sources
  for three popular scenarios, i.e., domain adaptation with limited label on target
  domain, unsupervised domain adaptation and label partial unsupervised domain adaption.
  We evaluate the proposed method through extensive experiments. The empirical results
  significantly outperform the baselines.'
