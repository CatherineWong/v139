title: Clusterability as an Alternative to Anchor Points When Learning with Noisy
  Labels
abstract: The label noise transition matrix, characterizing the probabilities of a
  training instance being wrongly annotated, is crucial to designing popular solutions
  to learning with noisy labels. Existing works heavily rely on finding “anchor points”
  or their approximates, defined as instances belonging to a particular class almost
  surely. Nonetheless, finding anchor points remains a non-trivial task, and the estimation
  accuracy is also often throttled by the number of available anchor points. In this
  paper, we propose an alternative option to the above task. Our main contribution
  is the discovery of an efficient estimation procedure based on a clusterability
  condition. We prove that with clusterable representations of features, using up
  to third-order consensuses of noisy labels among neighbor representations is sufficient
  to estimate a unique transition matrix. Compared with methods using anchor points,
  our approach uses substantially more instances and benefits from a much better sample
  complexity. We demonstrate the estimation accuracy and advantages of our estimates
  using both synthetic noisy labels (on CIFAR-10/100) and real human-level noisy labels
  (on Clothing1M and our self-collected human-annotated CIFAR-10). Our code and human-level
  noisy CIFAR-10 labels are available at https://github.com/UCSC-REAL/HOC.
