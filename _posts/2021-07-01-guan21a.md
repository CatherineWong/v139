title: 'AutoAttend: Automated Attention Representation Search'
abstract: Self-attention mechanisms have been widely adopted in many machine learning
  areas, including Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Graph Representation Learning
  (GRL), etc. However, existing works heavily rely on hand-crafted design to obtain
  customized attention mechanisms. In this paper, we automate Key, Query and Value
  representation design, which is one of the most important steps to obtain effective
  self-attentions. We propose an automated self-attention representation model, AutoAttend,
  which can automatically search powerful attention representations for downstream
  tasks leveraging Neural Architecture Search (NAS). In particular, we design a tailored
  search space for attention representation automation, which is flexible to produce
  effective attention representation designs. Based on the design prior obtained from
  attention representations in previous works, we further regularize our search space
  to reduce the space complexity without the loss of expressivity. Moreover, we propose
  a novel context-aware parameter sharing mechanism considering special characteristics
  of each sub-architecture to provide more accurate architecture estimations when
  conducting parameter sharing in our tailored search space. Experiments show the
  superiority of our proposed AutoAttend model over previous state-of-the-arts on
  eight text classification tasks in NLP and four node classification tasks in GRL.
