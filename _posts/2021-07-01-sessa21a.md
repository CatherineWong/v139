title: Online Submodular Resource Allocation with Applications to Rebalancing Shared
  Mobility Systems
abstract: Motivated by applications in shared mobility, we address the problem of
  allocating a group of agents to a set of resources to maximize a cumulative welfare
  objective. We model the welfare obtainable from each resource as a monotone DR-submodular
  function which is a-priori unknown and can only be learned by observing the welfare
  of selected allocations. Moreover, these functions can depend on time-varying contextual
  information. We propose a distributed scheme to maximize the cumulative welfare
  by designing a repeated game among the agents, who learn to act via regret minimization.
  We propose two design choices for the game rewards based on upper confidence bounds
  built around the unknown welfare functions. We analyze them theoretically, bounding
  the gap between the cumulative welfare of the game and the highest cumulative welfare
  obtainable in hindsight. Finally, we evaluate our approach in a realistic case study
  of rebalancing a shared mobility system (i.e., positioning vehicles in strategic
  areas). From observed trip data, our algorithm gradually learns the usersâ€™ demand
  pattern and improves the overall system operation.
