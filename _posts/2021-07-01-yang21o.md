title: 'SimAM: A Simple, Parameter-Free Attention Module for Convolutional Neural
  Networks'
abstract: In this paper, we propose a conceptually simple but very effective attention
  module for Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets). In contrast to existing channel-wise
  and spatial-wise attention modules, our module instead infers 3-D attention weights
  for the feature map in a layer without adding parameters to the original networks.
  Specifically, we base on some well-known neuroscience theories and propose to optimize
  an energy function to find the importance of each neuron. We further derive a fast
  closed-form solution for the energy function, and show that the solution can be
  implemented in less than ten lines of code. Another advantage of the module is that
  most of the operators are selected based on the solution to the defined energy function,
  avoiding too many efforts for structure tuning. Quantitative evaluations on various
  visual tasks demonstrate that the proposed module is flexible and effective to improve
  the representation ability of many ConvNets. Our code is available at Pytorch-SimAM.
