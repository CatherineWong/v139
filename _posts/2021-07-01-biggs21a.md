title: 'Model Distillation for Revenue Optimization: Interpretable Personalized Pricing'
abstract: Data-driven pricing strategies are becoming increasingly common, where customers
  are offered a personalized price based on features that are predictive of their
  valuation of a product. It is desirable for this pricing policy to be simple and
  interpretable, so it can be verified, checked for fairness, and easily implemented.
  However, efforts to incorporate machine learning into a pricing framework often
  lead to complex pricing policies that are not interpretable, resulting in slow adoption
  in practice. We present a novel, customized, prescriptive tree-based algorithm that
  distills knowledge from a complex black-box machine learning algorithm, segments
  customers with similar valuations and prescribes prices in such a way that maximizes
  revenue while maintaining interpretability. We quantify the regret of a resulting
  policy and demonstrate its efficacy in applications with both synthetic and real-world
  datasets.
