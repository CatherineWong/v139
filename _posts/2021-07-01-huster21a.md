title: 'Pareto GAN: Extending the Representational Power of GANs to Heavy-Tailed Distributions'
abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are often billed as "universal distribution
  learners", but precisely what distributions they can represent and learn is still
  an open question. Heavy-tailed distributions are prevalent in many different domains
  such as financial risk-assessment, physics, and epidemiology. We observe that existing
  GAN architectures do a poor job of matching the asymptotic behavior of heavy-tailed
  distributions, a problem that we show stems from their construction. Additionally,
  common loss functions produce unstable or near-zero gradients when faced with the
  infinite moments and large distances between outlier points characteristic of heavy-tailed
  distributions. We address these problems with the Pareto GAN. A Pareto GAN leverages
  extreme value theory and the functional properties of neural networks to learn a
  distribution that matches the asymptotic behavior of the marginal distributions
  of the features. We identify issues with standard loss functions and propose the
  use of alternative metric spaces that enable stable and efficient learning. Finally,
  we evaluate our proposed approach on a variety of heavy-tailed datasets.
