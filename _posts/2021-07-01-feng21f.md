title: 'KD3A: Unsupervised Multi-Source Decentralized Domain Adaptation via Knowledge
  Distillation'
abstract: 'Conventional unsupervised multi-source domain adaptation (UMDA) methods
  assume all source domains can be accessed directly. However, this assumption neglects
  the privacy-preserving policy, where all the data and computations must be kept
  decentralized. There exist three challenges in this scenario: (1) Minimizing the
  domain distance requires the pairwise calculation of the data from the source and
  target domains, while the data on the source domain is not available. (2) The communication
  cost and privacy security limit the application of existing UMDA methods, such as
  the domain adversarial training. (3) Since users cannot govern the data quality,
  the irrelevant or malicious source domains are more likely to appear, which causes
  negative transfer. To address the above problems, we propose a privacy-preserving
  UMDA paradigm named Knowledge Distillation based Decentralized Domain Adaptation
  (KD3A), which performs domain adaptation through the knowledge distillation on models
  from different source domains. The extensive experiments show that KD3A significantly
  outperforms state-of-the-art UMDA approaches. Moreover, the KD3A is robust to the
  negative transfer and brings a 100x reduction of communication cost compared with
  other decentralized UMDA methods.'
