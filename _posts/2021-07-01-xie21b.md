title: 'RNNRepair: Automatic RNN Repair via Model-based Analysis'
abstract: Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Due to their
  black-box nature, it is rather challenging to interpret and properly repair these
  incorrect behaviors. This paper focuses on interpreting and repairing the incorrect
  behaviors of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). We propose a lightweight model-based
  approach (RNNRepair) to help understand and repair incorrect behaviors of an RNN.
  Specifically, we build an influence model to characterize the stateful and statistical
  behaviors of an RNN over all the training data and to perform the influence analysis
  for the errors. Compared with the existing techniques on influence function, our
  method can efficiently estimate the influence of existing or newly added training
  samples for a given prediction at both sample level and segmentation level. Our
  empirical evaluation shows that the proposed influence model is able to extract
  accurate and understandable features. Based on the influence model, our proposed
  technique could effectively infer the influential instances from not only an entire
  testing sequence but also a segment within that sequence. Moreover, with the sample-level
  and segment-level influence relations, RNNRepair could further remediate two types
  of incorrect predictions at the sample level and segment level.
