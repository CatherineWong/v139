title: Almost Optimal Anytime Algorithm for Batched Multi-Armed Bandits
abstract: In batched multi-armed bandit problems, the learner can adaptively pull
  arms and adjust strategy in batches. In many real applications, not only the regret
  but also the batch complexity need to be optimized. Existing batched bandit algorithms
  usually assume that the time horizon T is known in advance. However, many applications
  involve an unpredictable stopping time. In this paper, we study the anytime batched
  multi-armed bandit problem. We propose an anytime algorithm that achieves the asymptotically
  optimal regret for exponential families of reward distributions with $O(\log \log
  T \ilog^{\alpha} (T))$ \footnote{Notation \ilog^{\alpha} (T) is the result of iteratively
  applying the logarithm function on T for \alpha times, e.g., \ilog^{3} (T)=\log\log\log
  T.} batches, where $\alpha\in O_{T}(1)$. Moreover, we prove that for any constant
  c>0, no algorithm can achieve the asymptotically optimal regret within c\log\log
  T batches.
