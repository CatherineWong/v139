title: 'WILDS: A Benchmark of in-the-Wild Distribution Shifts'
abstract: Distribution shifts—where the training distribution differs from the test
  distribution—can substantially degrade the accuracy of machine learning (ML) systems
  deployed in the wild. Despite their ubiquity in the real-world deployments, these
  distribution shifts are under-represented in the datasets widely used in the ML
  community today. To address this gap, we present WILDS, a curated benchmark of 10
  datasets reflecting a diverse range of distribution shifts that naturally arise
  in real-world applications, such as shifts across hospitals for tumor identification;
  across camera traps for wildlife monitoring; and across time and location in satellite
  imaging and poverty mapping. On each dataset, we show that standard training yields
  substantially lower out-of-distribution than in-distribution performance. This gap
  remains even with models trained by existing methods for tackling distribution shifts,
  underscoring the need for new methods for training models that are more robust to
  the types of distribution shifts that arise in practice. To facilitate method development,
  we provide an open-source package that automates dataset loading, contains default
  model architectures and hyperparameters, and standardizes evaluations. The full
  paper, code, and leaderboards are available at https://wilds.stanford.edu.
