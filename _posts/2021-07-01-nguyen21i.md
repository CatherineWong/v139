title: Differentially Private Densest Subgraph Detection
abstract: Densest subgraph detection is a fundamental graph mining problem, with a
  large number of applications. There has been a lot of work on efficient algorithms
  for finding the densest subgraph in massive networks. However, in many domains,
  the network is private, and returning a densest subgraph can reveal information
  about the network. Differential privacy is a powerful framework to handle such settings.
  We study the densest subgraph problem in the edge privacy model, in which the edges
  of the graph are private. We present the first sequential and parallel differentially
  private algorithms for this problem. We show that our algorithms have an additive
  approximation guarantee. We evaluate our algorithms on a large number of real-world
  networks, and observe a good privacy-accuracy tradeoff when the network has high
  density.
