title: Solving Challenging Dexterous Manipulation Tasks With Trajectory Optimisation
  and Reinforcement Learning
abstract: 'Training agents to autonomously control anthropomorphic robotic hands has
  the potential to lead to systems capable of performing a multitude of complex manipulation
  tasks in unstructured and uncertain environments. In this work, we first introduce
  a suite of challenging simulated manipulation tasks where current reinforcement
  learning and trajectory optimisation techniques perform poorly. These include environments
  where two simulated hands have to pass or throw objects between each other, as well
  as an environment where the agent must learn to spin a long pen between its fingers.
  We then introduce a simple trajectory optimisation algorithm that performs significantly
  better than existing methods on these environments. Finally, on the most challenging
  â€œPenSpin" task, we combine sub-optimal demonstrations generated through trajectory
  optimisation with off-policy reinforcement learning, obtaining performance that
  far exceeds either of these approaches individually. Videos of all of our results
