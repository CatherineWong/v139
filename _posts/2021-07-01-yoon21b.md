title: Federated Continual Learning with Weighted Inter-client Transfer
abstract: There has been a surge of interest in continual learning and federated learning,
  both of which are important in deep neural networks in real-world scenarios. Yet
  little research has been done regarding the scenario where each client learns on
  a sequence of tasks from a private local data stream. This problem of federated
  continual learning poses new challenges to continual learning, such as utilizing
  knowledge from other clients, while preventing interference from irrelevant knowledge.
  To resolve these issues, we propose a novel federated continual learning framework,
  Federated Weighted Inter-client Transfer (FedWeIT), which decomposes the network
  weights into global federated parameters and sparse task-specific parameters, and
  each client receives selective knowledge from other clients by taking a weighted
  combination of their task-specific parameters. FedWeIT minimizes interference between
  incompatible tasks, and also allows positive knowledge transfer across clients during
  learning. We validate our FedWeIT against existing federated learning and continual
  learning methods under varying degrees of task similarity across clients, and our
  model significantly outperforms them with a large reduction in the communication
  cost.
