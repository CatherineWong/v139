title: 'HEMET: A Homomorphic-Encryption-Friendly Privacy-Preserving Mobile Neural
  Network Architecture'
abstract: Recently Homomorphic Encryption (HE) is used to implement Privacy-Preserving
  Neural Networks (PPNNs) that perform inferences directly on encrypted data without
  decryption. Prior PPNNs adopt mobile network architectures such as SqueezeNet for
  smaller computing overhead, but we find na√Øvely using mobile network architectures
  for a PPNN does not necessarily achieve shorter inference latency. Despite having
  less parameters, a mobile network architecture typically introduces more layers
  and increases the HE multiplicative depth of a PPNN, thereby prolonging its inference
  latency. In this paper, we propose a \textbf{HE}-friendly privacy-preserving \textbf{M}obile
  neural n\textbf{ET}work architecture, \textbf{HEMET}. Experimental results show
  that, compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) PPNNs, HEMET reduces the inference latency
  by $59.3%\sim 61.2%$, and improves the inference accuracy by $0.4 % \sim 0.5%$.
