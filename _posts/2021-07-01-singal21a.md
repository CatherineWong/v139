title: 'Flow-based Attribution in Graphical Models: A Recursive Shapley Approach'
abstract: We study the attribution problem in a graphical model, wherein the objective
  is to quantify how the effect of changes at the source nodes propagates through
  the graph. We develop a model-agnostic flow-based attribution method, called recursive
  Shapley value (RSV). RSV generalizes a number of existing node-based methods and
  uniquely satisfies a set of flow-based axioms. In addition to admitting a natural
  characterization for linear models and facilitating mediation analysis for non-linear
  models, RSV satisfies a mix of desirable properties discussed in the recent literature,
  including implementation invariance, sensitivity, monotonicity, and affine scale
  invariance.
