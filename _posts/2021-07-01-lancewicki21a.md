title: Stochastic Multi-Armed Bandits with Unrestricted Delay Distributions
abstract: 'We study the stochastic Multi-Armed BanditÂ (MAB) problem with random delays
  in the feedback received by the algorithm. We consider two settings: the {\it reward
  dependent} delay setting, where realized delays may depend on the stochastic rewards,
  and the {\it reward-independent} delay setting. Our main contribution is algorithms
  that achieve near-optimal regret in each of the settings, with an additional additive
  dependence on the quantiles of the delay distribution. Our results do not make any
  assumptions on the delay distributions: in particular, we do not assume they come
  from any parametric family of distributions and allow for unbounded support and
  expectation; we further allow for the case of infinite delays where the algorithm
  might occasionally not observe any feedback.'
