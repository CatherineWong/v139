title: No-regret Algorithms for Capturing Events in Poisson Point Processes
abstract: 'Inhomogeneous Poisson point processes are widely used models of event occurrences.
  We address \emph{adaptive sensing of Poisson Point processes}, namely, maximizing
  the number of captured events subject to sensing costs. We encode prior assumptions
  on the rate function by modeling it as a member of a known \emph{reproducing kernel
  Hilbert space} (RKHS). By partitioning the domain into separate small regions, and
  using heteroscedastic linear regression, we propose a tractable estimator of Poisson
  process rates for two feedback models: \emph{count-record}, where exact locations
  of events are observed, and \emph{histogram} feedback, where only counts of events
  are observed. We derive provably accurate anytime confidence estimates for our estimators
  for sequentially acquired Poisson count data. Using these, we formulate algorithms
  based on optimism that provably incur sublinear count-regret. We demonstrate the
  practicality of the method on problems from crime modeling, revenue maximization
  as well as environmental monitoring.'
