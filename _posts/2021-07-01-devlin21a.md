title: 'Navigation Turing Test (NTT): Learning to Evaluate Human-Like Navigation'
abstract: A key challenge on the path to developing agents that learn complex human-like
  behavior is the need to quickly and accurately quantify human-likeness. While human
  assessments of such behavior can be highly accurate, speed and scalability are limited.
  We address these limitations through a novel automated Navigation Turing Test (ANTT)
  that learns to predict human judgments of human-likeness. We demonstrate the effectiveness
  of our automated NTT on a navigation task in a complex 3D environment. We investigate
  six classification models to shed light on the types of architectures best suited
  to this task, and validate them against data collected through a human NTT. Our
  best models achieve high accuracy when distinguishing true human and agent behavior.
  At the same time, we show that predicting finer-grained human assessment of agentsâ€™
  progress towards human-like behavior remains unsolved. Our work takes an important
  step towards agents that more effectively learn complex human-like behavior.
