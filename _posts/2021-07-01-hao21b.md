title: Bootstrapping Fitted Q-Evaluation for Off-Policy Inference
abstract: Bootstrapping provides a flexible and effective approach for assessing the
  quality of batch reinforcement learning, yet its theoretical properties are poorly
  understood. In this paper, we study the use of bootstrapping in off-policy evaluation
  (OPE), and in particular, we focus on the fitted Q-evaluation (FQE) that is known
  to be minimax-optimal in the tabular and linear-model cases. We propose a bootstrapping
  FQE method for inferring the distribution of the policy evaluation error and show
  that this method is asymptotically efficient and distributionally consistent for
  off-policy statistical inference. To overcome the computation limit of bootstrapping,
  we further adapt a subsampling procedure that improves the runtime by an order of
  magnitude. We numerically evaluate the bootrapping method in classical RL environments
  for confidence interval estimation, estimating the variance of off-policy evaluator,
  and estimating the correlation between multiple off-policy evaluators.
