title: Adversarial Combinatorial Bandits with General Non-linear Reward Functions
abstract: In this paper we study the adversarial combinatorial bandit with a known
  non-linear reward function, extending existing work on adversarial linear combinatorial
  bandit. {The adversarial combinatorial bandit with general non-linear reward is
  an important open problem in bandit literature, and it is still unclear whether
  there is a significant gap from the case of linear reward, stochastic bandit, or
  semi-bandit feedback.} We show that, with $N$ arms and subsets of $K$ arms being
  chosen at each of $T$ time periods, the minimax optimal regret is $\widetilde\Theta_{d}(\sqrt{N^d
  T})$ if the reward function is a $d$-degree polynomial with $d< K$, and $\Theta_K(\sqrt{N^K
  T})$ if the reward function is not a low-degree polynomial. {Both bounds are significantly
  different from the bound $O(\sqrt{\mathrm{poly}(N,K)T})$ for the linear case, which
  suggests that there is a fundamental gap between the linear and non-linear reward
  structures.} Our result also finds applications to adversarial assortment optimization
  problem in online recommendation. We show that in the worst-case of adversarial
  assortment problem, the optimal algorithm must treat each individual $\binom{N}{K}$
  assortment as independent.
