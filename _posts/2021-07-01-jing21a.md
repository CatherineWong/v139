title: Adversarial Option-Aware Hierarchical Imitation Learning
abstract: 'It has been a challenge to learning skills for an agent from long-horizon
  unannotated demonstrations. Existing approaches like Hierarchical Imitation Learning(HIL)
  are prone to compounding errors or suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we propose
  Option-GAIL, a novel method to learn skills at long horizon. The key idea of Option-GAIL
  is modeling the task hierarchy by options and train the policy via generative adversarial
  optimization. In particular, we propose an Expectation-Maximization(EM)-style algorithm:
  an E-step that samples the options of expert conditioned on the current learned
  policy, and an M-step that updates the low- and high-level policies of agent simultaneously
  to minimize the newly proposed option-occupancy measurement between the expert and
  the agent. We theoretically prove the convergence of the proposed algorithm. Experiments
  show that Option-GAIL outperforms other counterparts consistently across a variety
  of tasks.'
