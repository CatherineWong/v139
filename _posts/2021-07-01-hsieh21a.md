title: 'The Limits of Min-Max Optimization Algorithms: Convergence to Spurious Non-Critical
  Sets'
abstract: Compared to minimization, the min-max optimization in machine learning applications
  is considerably more convoluted because of the existence of cycles and similar phenomena.
  Such oscillatory behaviors are well-understood in the convex-concave regime, and
  many algorithms are known to overcome them. In this paper, we go beyond this basic
  setting and characterize the convergence properties of many popular methods in solving
  non-convex/non-concave problems. In particular, we show that a wide class of state-of-the-art
  schemes and heuristics may converge with arbitrarily high probability to attractors
  that are in no way min-max optimal or even stationary. Our work thus points out
  a potential pitfall among many existing theoretical frameworks, and we corroborate
  our theoretical claims by explicitly showcasing spurious attractors in simple two-dimensional
  problems.
