title: A Zeroth-Order Block Coordinate Descent Algorithm for Huge-Scale Black-Box
  Optimization
abstract: We consider the zeroth-order optimization problem in the huge-scale setting,
  where the dimension of the problem is so large that performing even basic vector
  operations on the decision variables is infeasible. In this paper, we propose a
  novel algorithm, coined ZO-BCD, that exhibits favorable overall query complexity
  and has a much smaller per-iteration computational complexity. In addition, we discuss
  how the memory footprint of ZO-BCD can be reduced even further by the clever use
  of circulant measurement matrices. As an application of our new method, we propose
  the idea of crafting adversarial attacks on neural network based classifiers in
  a wavelet domain, which can result in problem dimensions of over one million. In
  particular, we show that crafting adversarial examples to audio classifiers in a
  wavelet domain can achieve the state-of-the-art attack success rate of 97.9% with
  significantly less distortion.
