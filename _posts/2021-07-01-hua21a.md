title: A Scalable Deterministic Global Optimization Algorithm for Clustering Problems
abstract: The minimum sum-of-squares clustering (MSSC) task, which can be treated
  as a Mixed Integer Second Order Cone Programming (MISOCP) problem, is rarely investigated
  in the literature through deterministic optimization to find its global optimal
  value. In this paper, we modelled the MSSC task as a two-stage optimization problem
  and proposed a tailed reduced-space branch and bound (BB) algorithm. We designed
  several approaches to construct lower and upper bounds at each node in the BB scheme,
  including a scenario grouping based Lagrangian decomposition approach. One key advantage
  of this reduced-space algorithm is that it only needs to perform branching on the
  centers of clusters to guarantee convergence, and the size of centers is independent
  of the number of data samples. Moreover, the lower bounds can be computed by solving
  small-scale sample subproblems, and upper bounds can be obtained trivially. These
  two properties enable our algorithm easy to be paralleled and can be scalable to
  the dataset with up to 200,000 samples for finding a global $\epsilon$-optimal solution
  of the MSSC task. We performed numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world
  datasets and compared our proposed algorithms with the off-the-shelf global optimal
  solvers and classical local optimal algorithms. The results reveal a strong performance
  and scalability of our algorithm.
