title: Bayesian Quadrature on Riemannian Data Manifolds
abstract: Riemannian manifolds provide a principled way to model nonlinear geometric
  structure inherent in data. A Riemannian metric on said manifolds determines geometry-aware
  shortest paths and provides the means to define statistical models accordingly.
  However, these operations are typically computationally demanding. To ease this
  computational burden, we advocate probabilistic numerical methods for Riemannian
  statistics. In particular, we focus on Bayesian quadrature (BQ) to numerically compute
  integrals over normal laws on Riemannian manifolds learned from data. In this task,
  each function evaluation relies on the solution of an expensive initial value problem.
  We show that by leveraging both prior knowledge and an active exploration scheme,
  BQ significantly reduces the number of required evaluations and thus outperforms
  Monte Carlo methods on a wide range of integration problems. As a concrete application,
  we highlight the merits of adopting Riemannian geometry with our proposed framework
  on a nonlinear dataset from molecular dynamics.
