title: Context-Aware Online Collective Inference for Templated Graphical Models
abstract: In this work, we examine online collective inference, the problem of maintaining
  and performing inference over a sequence of evolving graphical models. We utilize
  templated graphical models (TGM), a general class of graphical models expressed
  via templates and instantiated with data. A key challenge is minimizing the cost
  of instantiating the updated model. To address this, we define a class of exact
  and approximate context-aware methods for updating an existing TGM. These methods
  avoid a full re-instantiation by using the context of the updates to only add relevant
  components to the graphical model. Further, we provide stability bounds for the
  general online inference problem and regret bounds for a proposed approximation.
  Finally, we implement our approach in probabilistic soft logic, and test it on several
  online collective inference tasks. Through these experiments we verify the bounds
  on regret and stability, and show that our approximate online approach consistently
  runs two to five times faster than the offline alternative while, surprisingly,
  maintaining the quality of the predictions.
