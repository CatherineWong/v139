title: Parallel and Flexible Sampling from Autoregressive Models via Langevin Dynamics
abstract: This paper introduces an alternative approach to sampling from autoregressive
  models. Autoregressive models are typically sampled sequentially, according to the
  transition dynamics defined by the model. Instead, we propose a sampling procedure
  that initializes a sequence with white noise and follows a Markov chain defined
  by Langevin dynamics on the global log-likelihood of the sequence. This approach
  parallelizes the sampling process and generalizes to conditional sampling. Using
  an autoregressive model as a Bayesian prior, we can steer the output of a generative
  model using a conditional likelihood or constraints. We apply these techniques to
  autoregressive models in the visual and audio domains, with competitive results
  for audio source separation, super-resolution, and inpainting.
