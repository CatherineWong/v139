title: A Receptor Skeleton for Capsule Neural Networks
abstract: In previous Capsule Neural Networks (CapsNets), routing algorithms often
  performed clustering processes to assemble the child capsules’ representations into
  parent capsules. Such routing algorithms were typically implemented with iterative
  processes and incurred high computing complexity. This paper presents a new capsule
  structure, which contains a set of optimizable receptors and a transmitter is devised
  on the capsule’s representation. Specifically, child capsules’ representations are
  sent to the parent capsules whose receptors match well the transmitters of the child
  capsules’ representations, avoiding applying computationally complex routing algorithms.
  To ensure the receptors in a CapsNet work cooperatively, we build a skeleton to
  organize the receptors in different capsule layers in a CapsNet. The receptor skeleton
  assigns a share-out objective for each receptor, making the CapsNet perform as a
  hierarchical agglomerative clustering process. Comprehensive experiments verify
  that our approach facilitates efficient clustering processes, and CapsNets with
  our approach significantly outperform CapsNets with previous routing algorithms
  on image classification, affine transformation generalization, overlapped object
  recognition, and representation semantic decoupling.
