title: Active Learning of Continuous-time Bayesian Networks through Interventions
abstract: We consider the problem of learning structures and parameters of Continuous-time
  Bayesian Networks (CTBNs) from time-course data under minimal experimental resources.
  In practice, the cost of generating experimental data poses a bottleneck, especially
  in the natural and social sciences. A popular approach to overcome this is Bayesian
  optimal experimental design (BOED). However, BOED becomes infeasible in high-dimensional
  settings, as it involves integration over all possible experimental outcomes. We
  propose a novel criterion for experimental design based on a variational approximation
  of the expected information gain. We show that for CTBNs, a semi-analytical expression
  for this criterion can be calculated for structure and parameter learning. By doing
  so, we can replace sampling over experimental outcomes by solving the CTBNs master-equation,
  for which scalable approximations exist. This alleviates the computational burden
  of sampling possible experimental outcomes in high-dimensions. We employ this framework
  to recommend interventional sequences. In this context, we extend the CTBN model
  to conditional CTBNs to incorporate interventions. We demonstrate the performance
  of our criterion on synthetic and real-world data.
