title: Diffusion Source Identification on Networks with Statistical Confidence
abstract: Diffusion source identification on networks is a problem of fundamental
  importance in a broad class of applications, including controlling the spreading
  of rumors on social media, identifying a computer virus over cyber networks, or
  identifying the disease center during epidemiology. Though this problem has received
  significant recent attention, most known approaches are well-studied in only very
  restrictive settings and lack theoretical guarantees for more realistic networks.
  We introduce a statistical framework for the study of this problem and develop a
  confidence set inference approach inspired by hypothesis testing. Our method efficiently
  produces a small subset of nodes, which provably covers the source node with any
  pre-specified confidence level without restrictive assumptions on network structures.
  To our knowledge, this is the first diffusion source identification method with
  a practically useful theoretical guarantee on general networks. We demonstrate our
  approach via extensive synthetic experiments on well-known random network models,
  a large data set of real-world networks as well as a mobility network between cities
  concerning the COVID-19 spreading in January 2020.
