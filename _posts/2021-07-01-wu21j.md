title: 'Towards Open-World Recommendation: An Inductive Model-based Collaborative
  Filtering Approach'
abstract: Recommendation models can effectively estimate underlying user interests
  and predict one’s future behaviors by factorizing an observed user-item rating matrix
  into products of two sets of latent factors. However, the user-specific embedding
  factors can only be learned in a transductive way, making it difficult to handle
  new users on-the-fly. In this paper, we propose an inductive collaborative filtering
  framework that contains two representation models. The first model follows conventional
  matrix factorization which factorizes a group of key users’ rating matrix to obtain
  meta latents. The second model resorts to attention-based structure learning that
  estimates hidden relations from query to key users and learns to leverage meta latents
  to inductively compute embeddings for query users via neural message passing. Our
  model enables inductive representation learning for users and meanwhile guarantees
  equivalent representation capacity as matrix factorization. Experiments demonstrate
  that our model achieves promising results for recommendation on few-shot users with
  limited training ratings and new unseen users which are commonly encountered in
  open-world recommender systems.
