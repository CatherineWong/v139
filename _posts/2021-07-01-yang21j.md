title: 'Voice2Series: Reprogramming Acoustic Models for Time Series Classification'
abstract: Learning to classify time series with limited data is a practical yet challenging
  problem. Current methods are primarily based on hand-designed feature extraction
  rules or domain-specific data augmentation. Motivated by the advances in deep speech
  processing models and the fact that voice data are univariate temporal signals,
  in this paper we propose Voice2Serie (V2S), a novel end-to-end approach that reprograms
  acoustic models for time series classification, through input transformation learning
  and output label mapping. Leveraging the representation learning power of a large-scale
  pre-trained speech processing model, on 31 different time series tasks we show that
  V2S outperforms or is on part with state-of-the-art methods on 22 tasks, and improves
  their average accuracy by 1.72%. We further provide theoretical justification of
  V2S by proving its population risk is upper bounded by the source risk and a Wasserstein
  distance accounting for feature alignment via reprogramming. Our results offer new
  and effective means to time series classification.
