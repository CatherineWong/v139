title: Revisiting Point Cloud Shape Classification with a Simple and Effective Baseline
abstract: Processing point cloud data is an important component of many real-world
  systems. As such, a wide variety of point-based approaches have been proposed, reporting
  steady benchmark improvements over time. We study the key ingredients of this progress
  and uncover two critical results. First, we find that auxiliary factors like different
  evaluation schemes, data augmentation strategies, and loss functions, which are
  independent of the model architecture, make a large difference in performance. The
  differences are large enough that they obscure the effect of architecture. When
  these factors are controlled for, PointNet++, a relatively older network, performs
  competitively with recent methods. Second, a very simple projection-based method,
  which we refer to as SimpleView, performs surprisingly well. It achieves on par
  or better results than sophisticated state-of-the-art methods on ModelNet40 while
  being half the size of PointNet++. It also outperforms state-of-the-art methods
  on ScanObjectNN, a real-world point cloud benchmark, and demonstrates better cross-dataset
  generalization. Code is available at https://github.com/princeton-vl/SimpleView.
