title: 'Markpainting: Adversarial Machine Learning meets Inpainting'
abstract: 'Inpainting is a learned interpolation technique that is based on generative
  modeling and used to populate masked or missing pieces in an image; it has wide
  applications in picture editing and retouching. Recently, inpainting started being
  used for watermark removal, raising concerns. In this paper we study how to manipulate
  it using our markpainting technique. First, we show how an image owner with access
  to an inpainting model can augment their image in such a way that any attempt to
  edit it using that model will add arbitrary visible information. We find that we
  can target multiple different models simultaneously with our technique. This can
  be designed to reconstitute a watermark if the editor had been trying to remove
  it. Second, we show that our markpainting technique is transferable to models that
  have different architectures or were trained on different datasets, so watermarks
  created using it are difficult for adversaries to remove. Markpainting is novel
  and can be used as a manipulation alarm that becomes visible in the event of inpainting.
