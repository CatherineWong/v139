title: 'Generalization Bounds in the Presence of Outliers: a Median-of-Means Study'
abstract: In contrast to the empirical mean, the Median-of-Means (MoM) is an estimator
  of the mean $\theta$ of a square integrable r.v. Z, around which accurate nonasymptotic
  confidence bounds can be built, even when Z does not exhibit a sub-Gaussian tail
  behavior. Thanks to the high confidence it achieves on heavy-tailed data, MoM has
  found various applications in machine learning, where it is used to design training
  procedures that are not sensitive to atypical observations. More recently, a new
  line of work is now trying to characterize and leverage MoM’s ability to deal with
  corrupted data. In this context, the present work proposes a general study of MoM’s
  concentration properties under the contamination regime, that provides a clear understanding
  on the impact of the outlier proportion and the number of blocks chosen. The analysis
  is extended to (multisample) U-statistics, i.e. averages over tuples of observations,
  that raise additional challenges due to the dependence induced. Finally, we show
  that the latter bounds can be used in a straightforward fashion to derive generalization
  guarantees for pairwise learning in a contaminated setting, and propose an algorithm
  to compute provably reliable decision functions.
