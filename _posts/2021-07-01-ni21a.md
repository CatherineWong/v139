title: Data Augmentation for Meta-Learning
abstract: Conventional image classifiers are trained by randomly sampling mini-batches
  of images. To achieve state-of-the-art performance, practitioners use sophisticated
  data augmentation schemes to expand the amount of training data available for sampling.
  In contrast, meta-learning algorithms sample support data, query data, and tasks
  on each training step. In this complex sampling scenario, data augmentation can
  be used not only to expand the number of images available per class, but also to
  generate entirely new classes/tasks. We systematically dissect the meta-learning
  pipeline and investigate the distinct ways in which data augmentation can be integrated
  at both the image and class levels. Our proposed meta-specific data augmentation
  significantly improves the performance of meta-learners on few-shot classification
  benchmarks.
