title: Scaling Up Visual and Vision-Language Representation Learning With Noisy Text
  Supervision
abstract: Pre-trained representations are becoming crucial for many NLP and perception
  tasks. While representation learning in NLP has transitioned to training on raw
  text without human annotations, visual and vision-language representations still
  rely heavily on curated training datasets that are expensive or require expert knowledge.
  For vision applications, representations are mostly learned using datasets with
  explicit class labels such as ImageNet or OpenImages. For vision-language, popular
  datasets like Conceptual Captions, MSCOCO, or CLIP all involve a non-trivial data
  collection (and cleaning) process. This costly curation process limits the size
  of datasets and hence hinders the scaling of trained models. In this paper, we leverage
  a noisy dataset of over one billion image alt-text pairs, obtained without expensive
  filtering or post-processing steps in the Conceptual Captions dataset. A simple
  dual-encoder architecture learns to align visual and language representations of
  the image and text pairs using a contrastive loss. We show that the scale of our
  corpus can make up for its noise and leads to state-of-the-art representations even
  with such a simple learning scheme. Our visual representation achieves strong performance
  when transferred to classification tasks such as ImageNet and VTAB. The aligned
  visual and language representations enables zero-shot image classification and also
  set new state-of-the-art results on Flickr30K and MSCOCO image-text retrieval benchmarks,
  even when compared with more sophisticated cross-attention models. The representations
  also enable cross-modality search with complex text and text + image queries.
