title: Whitening for Self-Supervised Representation Learning
abstract: 'Most of the current self-supervised representation learning (SSL) methods
  are based on the contrastive loss and the instance-discrimination task, where augmented
  versions of the same image instance ("positives") are contrasted with instances
  extracted from other images ("negatives"). For the learning to be effective, many
  negatives should be compared with a positive pair, which is computationally demanding.
  In this paper, we propose a different direction and a new loss function for SSL,
  which is based on the whitening of the latent-space features. The whitening operation
  has a "scattering" effect on the batch samples, avoiding degenerate solutions where
  all the sample representations collapse to a single point. Our solution does not
  require asymmetric networks and it is conceptually simple. Moreover, since negatives
  are not needed, we can extract multiple positive pairs from the same image instance.
  The source code of the method and of all the experiments is available at: https://github.com/htdt/self-supervised.'
