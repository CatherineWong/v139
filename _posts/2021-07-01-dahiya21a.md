title: 'SiameseXML: Siamese Networks meet Extreme Classifiers with 100M Labels'
abstract: Deep extreme multi-label learning (XML) requires training deep architectures
  that can tag a data point with its most relevant subset of labels from an extremely
  large label set. XML applications such as ad and product recommendation involve
  labels rarely seen during training but which nevertheless hold the key to recommendations
  that delight users. Effective utilization of label metadata and high quality predictions
  for rare labels at the scale of millions of labels are thus key challenges in contemporary
  XML research. To address these, this paper develops the SiameseXML framework based
  on a novel probabilistic model that naturally motivates a modular approach melding
  Siamese architectures with high-capacity extreme classifiers, and a training pipeline
  that effortlessly scales to tasks with 100 million labels. SiameseXML offers predictions
  2â€“13% more accurate than leading XML methods on public benchmark datasets, as well
  as in live A/B tests on the Bing search engine, it offers significant gains in click-through-rates,
  coverage, revenue and other online metrics over state-of-the-art techniques currently
  in production. Code for SiameseXML is available at https://github.com/Extreme-classification/siamesexml
