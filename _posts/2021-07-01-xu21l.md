title: Group-Sparse Matrix Factorization for Transfer Learning of Word Embeddings
abstract: Sparse regression has recently been applied to enable transfer learning
  from very limited data. We study an extension of this approach to unsupervised learning—in
  particular, learning word embeddings from unstructured text corpora using low-rank
  matrix factorization. Intuitively, when transferring word embeddings to a new domain,
  we expect that the embeddings change for only a small number of words—e.g., the
  ones with novel meanings in that domain. We propose a novel group-sparse penalty
  that exploits this sparsity to perform transfer learning when there is very little
  text data available in the target domain—e.g., a single article of text. We prove
  generalization bounds for our algorithm. Furthermore, we empirically evaluate its
  effectiveness, both in terms of prediction accuracy in downstream tasks as well
  as in terms of interpretability of the results.
