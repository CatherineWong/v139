title: Breaking the Limits of Message Passing Graph Neural Networks
abstract: Since the Message Passing (Graph) Neural Networks (MPNNs) have a linear
  complexity with respect to the number of nodes when applied to sparse graphs, they
  have been widely implemented and still raise a lot of interest even though their
  theoretical expressive power is limited to the first order Weisfeiler-Lehman test
  (1-WL). In this paper, we show that if the graph convolution supports are designed
  in spectral-domain by a non-linear custom function of eigenvalues and masked with
  an arbitrary large receptive field, the MPNN is theoretically more powerful than
  the 1-WL test and experimentally as powerful as a 3-WL existing models, while remaining
  spatially localized. Moreover, by designing custom filter functions, outputs can
  have various frequency components that allow the convolution process to learn different
  relationships between a given input graph signal and its associated properties.
  So far, the best 3-WL equivalent graph neural networks have a computational complexity
  in $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ with memory usage in $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$, consider non-local
  update mechanism and do not provide the spectral richness of output profile. The
  proposed method overcomes all these aforementioned problems and reaches state-of-the-art
  results in many downstream tasks.
