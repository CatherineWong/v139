title: On a Combination of Alternating Minimization and Nesterov’s Momentum
abstract: Alternating minimization (AM) procedures are practically efficient in many
  applications for solving convex and non-convex optimization problems. On the other
  hand, Nesterov’s accelerated gradient is theoretically optimal first-order method
  for convex optimization. In this paper we combine AM and Nesterov’s acceleration
  to propose an accelerated alternating minimization algorithm. We prove $1/k^2$ convergence
  rate in terms of the objective for convex problems and $1/k$ in terms of the squared
  gradient norm for non-convex problems, where $k$ is the iteration counter. Our method
  does not require any knowledge of neither convexity of the problem nor function
  parameters such as Lipschitz constant of the gradient, i.e. it is adaptive to convexity
  and smoothness and is uniformly optimal for smooth convex and non-convex problems.
  Further, we develop its primal-dual modification for strongly convex problems with
  linear constraints and prove the same $1/k^2$ for the primal objective residual
  and constraints feasibility.
