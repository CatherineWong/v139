title: Isometric Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model for Dissimilarity Data
abstract: We present a probabilistic model where the latent variable respects both
  the distances and the topology of the modeled data. The model leverages the Riemannian
  geometry of the generated manifold to endow the latent space with a well-defined
  stochastic distance measure, which is modeled locally as Nakagami distributions.
  These stochastic distances are sought to be as similar as possible to observed distances
  along a neighborhood graph through a censoring process. The model is inferred by
  variational inference based on observations of pairwise distances. We demonstrate
  how the new model can encode invariances in the learned manifolds.
