title: On Reinforcement Learning with Adversarial Corruption and Its Application to
  Block MDP
abstract: We study reinforcement learning (RL) in episodic tabular MDPs with adversarial
  corruptions, where some episodes can be adversarially corrupted. When the total
  number of corrupted episodes is known, we propose an algorithm, Corruption Robust
  Monotonic Value Propagation (\textsf{CR-MVP}), which achieves a regret bound of
  $\tilde{O}\left(\left(\sqrt{SAK}+S^2A+CSA)\right)\polylog(H)\right)$, where $S$
  is the number of states, $A$ is the number of actions, $H$ is the planning horizon,
  $K$ is the number of episodes, and $C$ is the corruption level. We also provide
  a corresponding lower bound, which indicates that our upper bound is tight. Finally,
  as an application, we study RL with rich observations in the block MDP model. We
  provide the first algorithm that achieves a $\sqrt{K}$-type regret in this setting
  and is computationally efficient.
