title: Large-Scale Meta-Learning with Continual Trajectory Shifting
abstract: Meta-learning of shared initialization parameters has shown to be highly
  effective in solving few-shot learning tasks. However, extending the framework to
  many-shot scenarios, which may further enhance its practicality, has been relatively
  overlooked due to the technical difficulties of meta-learning over long chains of
  inner-gradient steps. In this paper, we first show that allowing the meta-learners
  to take a larger number of inner gradient steps better captures the structure of
  heterogeneous and large-scale task distributions, thus results in obtaining better
  initialization points. Further, in order to increase the frequency of meta-updates
  even with the excessively long inner-optimization trajectories, we propose to estimate
  the required shift of the task-specific parameters with respect to the change of
  the initialization parameters. By doing so, we can arbitrarily increase the frequency
  of meta-updates and thus greatly improve the meta-level convergence as well as the
  quality of the learned initializations. We validate our method on a heterogeneous
  set of large-scale tasks, and show that the algorithm largely outperforms the previous
  first-order meta-learning methods in terms of both generalization performance and
  convergence, as well as multi-task learning and fine-tuning baselines.
