title: Generative Causal Explanations for Graph Neural Networks
abstract: This paper presents {\em Gem}, a model-agnostic approach for providing interpretable
  explanations for any GNNs on various graph learning tasks. Specifically, we formulate
  the problem of providing explanations for the decisions of GNNs as a causal learning
  task. Then we train a causal explanation model equipped with a loss function based
  on Granger causality. Different from existing explainers for GNNs, {\em Gem} explains
  GNNs on graph-structured data from a causal perspective. It has better generalization
  ability as it has no requirements on the internal structure of the GNNs or prior
  knowledge on the graph learning tasks. In addition, {\em Gem}, once trained, can
  be used to explain the target GNN very quickly. Our theoretical analysis shows that
  several recent explainers fall into a unified framework of {\em additive feature
  attribution methods}. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets
  show that {\em Gem} achieves a relative increase of the explanation accuracy by
  up to $30%$ and speeds up the explanation process by up to $110\times$ as compared
  to its state-of-the-art alternatives.
