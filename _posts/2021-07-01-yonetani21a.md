title: Path Planning using Neural A* Search
abstract: We present Neural A*, a novel data-driven search method for path planning
  problems. Despite the recent increasing attention to data-driven path planning,
  machine learning approaches to search-based planning are still challenging due to
  the discrete nature of search algorithms. In this work, we reformulate a canonical
  A* search algorithm to be differentiable and couple it with a convolutional encoder
  to form an end-to-end trainable neural network planner. Neural A* solves a path
  planning problem by encoding a problem instance to a guidance map and then performing
  the differentiable A* search with the guidance map. By learning to match the search
  results with ground-truth paths provided by experts, Neural A* can produce a path
  consistent with the ground truth accurately and efficiently. Our extensive experiments
  confirmed that Neural A* outperformed state-of-the-art data-driven planners in terms
  of the search optimality and efficiency trade-off. Furthermore, Neural A* successfully
  predicted realistic human trajectories by directly performing search-based planning
  on natural image inputs.
