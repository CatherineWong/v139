title: Theory of Spectral Method for Union of Subspaces-Based Random Geometry Graph
abstract: Spectral method is a commonly used scheme to cluster data points lying close
  to Union of Subspaces, a task known as Subspace Clustering. The typical usage is
  to construct a Random Geometry Graph first and then apply spectral method to the
  graph to obtain clustering result. The latter step has been coined the name Spectral
  Clustering. As far as we know, in spite of the significance of both steps in spectral-method-based
  Subspace Clustering, all existing theoretical results focus on the first step of
  constructing the graph, but ignore the final step to correct false connections through
  spectral clustering. This paper establishes a theory to show the power of this method
  for the first time, in which we demonstrate the mechanism of spectral clustering
  by analyzing a simplified algorithm under the widely used semi-random model. Based
  on this theory, we prove the efficiency of Subspace Clustering in fairly broad conditions.
  The insights and analysis techniques developed in this paper might also have implications
  for other random graph problems.
