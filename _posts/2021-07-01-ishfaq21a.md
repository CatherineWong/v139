title: Randomized Exploration in Reinforcement Learning with General Value Function
  Approximation
abstract: We propose a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm inspired by the
  popular randomized least squares value iteration (RLSVI) algorithm as well as the
  optimism principle. Unlike existing upper-confidence-bound (UCB) based approaches,
  which are often computationally intractable, our algorithm drives exploration by
  simply perturbing the training data with judiciously chosen i.i.d. scalar noises.
  To attain optimistic value function estimation without resorting to a UCB-style
  bonus, we introduce an optimistic reward sampling procedure. When the value functions
  can be represented by a function class $\mathcal{F}$, our algorithm achieves a worst-case
  regret bound of $\tilde{O}(\mathrm{poly}(d_EH)\sqrt{T})$ where $T$ is the time elapsed,
  $H$ is the planning horizon and $d_E$ is the \emph{eluder dimension} of $\mathcal{F}$.
  In the linear setting, our algorithm reduces to LSVI-PHE, a variant of RLSVI, that
  enjoys an $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{d^3H^3T})$ regret. We complement the theory
  with an empirical evaluation across known difficult exploration tasks.
