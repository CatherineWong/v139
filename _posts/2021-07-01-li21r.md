title: Testing DNN-based Autonomous Driving Systems under Critical Environmental Conditions
abstract: Due to the increasing usage of Deep Neural Network (DNN) based autonomous
  driving systems (ADS) where erroneous or unexpected behaviours can lead to catastrophic
  accidents, testing such systems is of growing importance. Existing approaches often
  just focus on finding erroneous behaviours and have not thoroughly studied the impact
  of environmental conditions. In this paper, we propose to test DNN-based ADS under
  different environmental conditions to identify the critical ones, that is, the environmental
  conditions under which the ADS are more prone to errors. To tackle the problem of
  the space of environmental conditions being extremely large, we present a novel
  approach named TACTIC that employs the search-based method to identify critical
  environmental conditions generated by an image-to-image translation model. Large-scale
  experiments show that TACTIC can effectively identify critical environmental conditions
  and produce realistic testing images, and meanwhile, reveal more erroneous behaviours
  compared to existing approaches.
