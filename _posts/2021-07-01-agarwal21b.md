title: A Regret Minimization Approach to Iterative Learning Control
abstract: We consider the setting of iterative learning control, or model-based policy
  learning in the presence of uncertain, time-varying dynamics. In this setting, we
  propose a new performance metric, planning regret, which replaces the standard stochastic
  uncertainty assumptions with worst case regret. Based on recent advances in non-stochastic
  control, we design a new iterative algorithm for minimizing planning regret that
  is more robust to model mismatch and uncertainty. We provide theoretical and empirical
  evidence that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing methods on several benchmarks.
