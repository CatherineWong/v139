title: Tightening the Dependence on Horizon in the Sample Complexity of Q-Learning
abstract: Q-learning, which seeks to learn the optimal Q-function of a Markov decision
  process (MDP) in a model-free fashion, lies at the heart of reinforcement learning.
  Focusing on the synchronous setting (such that independent samples for all state-action
  pairs are queried via a generative model in each iteration), substantial progress
  has been made recently towards understanding the sample efficiency of Q-learning.
  To yield an entrywise $\varepsilon$-accurate estimate of the optimal Q-function,
  state-of-the-art theory requires at least an order of $\frac{|S||A|}{(1-\gamma)^5\varepsilon^{2}}$
  samples in the infinite-horizon $\gamma$-discounted setting. In this work, we sharpen
  the sample complexity of synchronous Q-learning to the order of $\frac{|S||A|}{(1-\gamma)^4\varepsilon^2}$
  (up to some logarithmic factor) for any $0<\varepsilon <1$, leading to an order-wise
  improvement in $\frac{1}{1-\gamma}$. Analogous results are derived for finite-horizon
  MDPs as well. Notably, our sample complexity analysis unveils the effectiveness
  of vanilla Q-learning, which matches that of speedy Q-learning without requiring
  extra computation and storage. Our result is obtained by identifying novel error
  decompositions and recursion relations, which might shed light on how to study other
  variants of Q-learning.
