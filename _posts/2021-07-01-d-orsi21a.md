title: Consistent regression when oblivious outliers overwhelm
abstract: We consider a robust linear regression model $y=X\beta^* + \eta$, where
  an adversary oblivious to the design $X\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times d}$ may choose $\eta$
  to corrupt all but an $\alpha$ fraction of the observations $y$ in an arbitrary
  way. Prior to our work, even for Gaussian $X$, no estimator for $\beta^*$ was known
  to be consistent in this model except for quadratic sample size $n \gtrsim (d/\alpha)^2$
  or for logarithmic inlier fraction $\alpha\ge 1/\log n$. We show that consistent
  estimation is possible with nearly linear sample size and inverse-polynomial inlier
  fraction. Concretely, we show that the Huber loss estimator is consistent for every
  sample size $n= \omega(d/\alpha^2)$ and achieves an error rate of $O(d/\alpha^2n)^{1/2}$
  (both bounds are optimal up to constant factors). Our results extend to designs
  far beyond the Gaussian case and only require the column span of $X$ to not contain
  approximately sparse vectors (similar to the kind of assumption commonly made about
  the kernel space for compressed sensing). We provide two technically similar proofs.
  One proof is phrased in terms of strong convexity, extending work of [Tsakonas et
  al. ’14], and particularly short. The other proof highlights a connection between
  the Huber loss estimator and high-dimensional median computations. In the special
  case of Gaussian designs, this connection leads us to a strikingly simple algorithm
  based on computing coordinate-wise medians that achieves nearly optimal guarantees
  in linear time, and that can exploit sparsity of $\beta^*$. The model studied here
  also captures heavy-tailed noise distributions that may not even have a first moment.
