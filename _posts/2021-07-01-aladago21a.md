title: 'Slot Machines: Discovering Winning Combinations of Random Weights in Neural
  Networks'
abstract: In contrast to traditional weight optimization in a continuous space, we
  demonstrate the existence of effective random networks whose weights are never updated.
  By selecting a weight among a fixed set of random values for each individual connection,
  our method uncovers combinations of random weights that match the performance of
  traditionally-trained networks of the same capacity. We refer to our networks as
  "slot machines" where each reel (connection) contains a fixed set of symbols (random
  values). Our backpropagation algorithm "spins" the reels to seek "winning" combinations,
  i.e., selections of random weight values that minimize the given loss. Quite surprisingly,
  we find that allocating just a few random values to each connection (e.g., 8 values
  per connection) yields highly competitive combinations despite being dramatically
  more constrained compared to traditionally learned weights. Moreover, finetuning
  these combinations often improves performance over the trained baselines. A randomly
  initialized VGG-19 with 8 values per connection contains a combination that achieves
  91% test accuracy on CIFAR-10. Our method also achieves an impressive performance
  of 98.2% on MNIST for neural networks containing only random weights.
