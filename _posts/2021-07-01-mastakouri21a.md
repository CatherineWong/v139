title: Necessary and sufficient conditions for causal feature selection in time series
  with latent common causes
abstract: We study the identification of direct and indirect causes on time series
  with latent variables, and provide a constrained-based causal feature selection
  method, which we prove that is both sound and complete under some graph constraints.
  Our theory and estimation algorithm require only two conditional independence tests
  for each observed candidate time series to determine whether or not it is a cause
  of an observed target time series. Furthermore, our selection of the conditioning
  set is such that it improves signal to noise ratio. We apply our method on real
  data, and on a wide range of simulated experiments, which yield very low false positive
  and relatively low false negative rates.
