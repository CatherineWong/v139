title: Locally Persistent Exploration in Continuous Control Tasks with Sparse Rewards
abstract: 'A major challenge in reinforcement learning is the design of exploration
  strategies, especially for environments with sparse reward structures and continuous
  state and action spaces. Intuitively, if the reinforcement signal is very scarce,
  the agent should rely on some form of short-term memory in order to cover its environment
  efficiently. We propose a new exploration method, based on two intuitions: (1) the
  choice of the next exploratory action should depend not only on the (Markovian)
  state of the environment, but also on the agentâ€™s trajectory so far, and (2) the
  agent should utilize a measure of spread in the state space to avoid getting stuck
  in a small region. Our method leverages concepts often used in statistical physics
  to provide explanations for the behavior of simplified (polymer) chains in order
  to generate persistent (locally self-avoiding) trajectories in state space. We discuss
  the theoretical properties of locally self-avoiding walks and their ability to provide
  a kind of short-term memory through a decaying temporal correlation within the trajectory.
  We provide empirical evaluations of our approach in a simulated 2D navigation task,
  as well as higher-dimensional MuJoCo continuous control locomotion tasks with sparse
  rewards.'
