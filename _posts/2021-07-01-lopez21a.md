title: 'Symmetric Spaces for Graph Embeddings: A Finsler-Riemannian Approach'
abstract: Learning faithful graph representations as sets of vertex embeddings has
  become a fundamental intermediary step in a wide range of machine learning applications.
  We propose the systematic use of symmetric spaces in representation learning, a
  class encompassing many of the previously used embedding targets. This enables us
  to introduce a new method, the use of Finsler metrics integrated in a Riemannian
  optimization scheme, that better adapts to dissimilar structures in the graph. We
  develop a tool to analyze the embeddings and infer structural properties of the
  data sets. For implementation, we choose Siegel spaces, a versatile family of symmetric
  spaces. Our approach outperforms competitive baselines for graph reconstruction
  tasks on various synthetic and real-world datasets. We further demonstrate its applicability
  on two downstream tasks, recommender systems and node classification.
