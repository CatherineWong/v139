title: Active Covering
abstract: We analyze the problem of active covering, where the learner is given an
  unlabeled dataset and can sequentially label query examples. The objective is to
  label query all of the positive examples in the fewest number of total label queries.
  We show under standard non-parametric assumptions that a classical support estimator
  can be repurposed as an offline algorithm attaining an excess query cost of $\widetilde{\Theta}(n^{D/(D+1)})$
  compared to the optimal learner, where $n$ is the number of datapoints and $D$ is
  the dimension. We then provide a simple active learning method that attains an improved
  excess query cost of $\widetilde{O}(n^{(D-1)/D})$. Furthermore, the proposed algorithms
  only require access to the positive labeled examples, which in certain settings
  provides additional computational and privacy benefits. Finally, we show that the
  active learning method consistently outperforms offline methods as well as a variety
  of baselines on a wide range of benchmark image-based datasets.
