title: Wasserstein Distributional Normalization For Robust Distributional Certification
  of Noisy Labeled Data
abstract: We propose a novel Wasserstein distributional normalization method that
  can classify noisy labeled data accurately. Recently, noisy labels have been successfully
  handled based on small-loss criteria, but have not been clearly understood from
  the theoretical point of view. In this paper, we address this problem by adopting
  distributionally robust optimization (DRO). In particular, we present a theoretical
  investigation of the distributional relationship between uncertain and certain samples
  based on the small-loss criteria. Our method takes advantage of this relationship
  to exploit useful information from uncertain samples. To this end, we normalize
  uncertain samples into the robustly certified region by introducing the non-parametric
  Ornstein-Ulenbeck type of Wasserstein gradient flows called Wasserstein distributional
  normalization, which is cheap and fast to implement. We verify that network confidence
  and distributional certification are fundamentally correlated and show the concentration
  inequality when the network escapes from over-parameterization. Experimental results
  demonstrate that our non-parametric classification method outperforms other parametric
  baselines on the Clothing1M and CIFAR-10/100 datasets when the data have diverse
  noisy labels.
