title: Near-Optimal Confidence Sequences for Bounded Random Variables
abstract: Many inference problems, such as sequential decision problems like A/B testing,
  adaptive sampling schemes like bandit selection, are often online in nature. The
  fundamental problem for online inference is to provide a sequence of confidence
  intervals that are valid uniformly over the growing-into-infinity sample sizes.
  To address this question, we provide a near-optimal confidence sequence for bounded
  random variables by utilizing Bentkus’ concentration results. We show that it improves
  on the existing approaches that use the Cram{é}r-Chernoff technique such as the
  Hoeffding, Bernstein, and Bennett inequalities. The resulting confidence sequence
  is confirmed to be favorable in synthetic coverage problems, adaptive stopping algorithms,
  and multi-armed bandit problems.
