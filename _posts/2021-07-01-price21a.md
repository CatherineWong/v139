title: 'Dense for the Price of Sparse: Improved Performance of Sparsely Initialized
  Networks via a Subspace Offset'
abstract: That neural networks may be pruned to high sparsities and retain high accuracy
  is well established. Recent research efforts focus on pruning immediately after
  initialization so as to allow the computational savings afforded by sparsity to
  extend to the training process. In this work, we introduce a new ‘DCT plus Sparse’
  layer architecture, which maintains information propagation and trainability even
  with as little as 0.01% trainable parameters remaining. We show that standard training
  of networks built with these layers, and pruned at initialization, achieves state-of-the-art
  accuracy for extreme sparsities on a variety of benchmark network architectures
  and datasets. Moreover, these results are achieved using only simple heuristics
  to determine the locations of the trainable parameters in the network, and thus
  without having to initially store or compute with the full, unpruned network, as
  is required by competing prune-at-initialization algorithms. Switching from standard
  sparse layers to DCT plus Sparse layers does not increase the storage footprint
  of a network and incurs only a small additional computational overhead.
