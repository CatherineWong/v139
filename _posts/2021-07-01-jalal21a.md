title: Instance-Optimal Compressed Sensing via Posterior Sampling
abstract: We characterize the measurement complexity of compressed sensing of signals
  drawn from a known prior distribution, even when the support of the prior is the
  entire space (rather than, say, sparse vectors). We show for Gaussian measurements
  and \emph{any} prior distribution on the signal, that the posterior sampling estimator
  achieves near-optimal recovery guarantees. Moreover, this result is robust to model
  mismatch, as long as the distribution estimate (e.g., from an invertible generative
  model) is close to the true distribution in Wasserstein distance. We implement the
  posterior sampling estimator for deep generative priors using Langevin dynamics,
  and empirically find that it produces accurate estimates with more diversity than
  MAP.
