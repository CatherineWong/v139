title: Heterogeneous Risk Minimization
abstract: Machine learning algorithms with empirical risk minimization usually suffer
  from poor generalization performance due to the greedy exploitation of correlations
  among the training data, which are not stable under distributional shifts. Recently,
  some invariant learning methods for out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization have
  been proposed by leveraging multiple training environments to find invariant relationships.
  However, modern datasets are frequently assembled by merging data from multiple
  sources without explicit source labels. The resultant unobserved heterogeneity renders
  many invariant learning methods inapplicable. In this paper, we propose Heterogeneous
  Risk Minimization (HRM) framework to achieve joint learning of latent heterogeneity
  among the data and invariant relationship, which leads to stable prediction despite
  distributional shifts. We theoretically characterize the roles of the environment
  labels in invariant learning and justify our newly proposed HRM framework. Extensive
  experimental results validate the effectiveness of our HRM framework.
