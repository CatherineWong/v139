title: 'Inverse Decision Modeling: Learning Interpretable Representations of Behavior'
abstract: 'Decision analysis deals with modeling and enhancing decision processes.
  A principal challenge in improving behavior is in obtaining a transparent *description*
  of existing behavior in the first place. In this paper, we develop an expressive,
  unifying perspective on *inverse decision modeling*: a framework for learning parameterized
  representations of sequential decision behavior. First, we formalize the *forward*
  problem (as a normative standard), subsuming common classes of control behavior.
  Second, we use this to formalize the *inverse* problem (as a descriptive model),
  generalizing existing work on imitation/reward learning—while opening up a much
  broader class of research problems in behavior representation. Finally, we instantiate
  this approach with an example (*inverse bounded rational control*), illustrating
  how this structure enables learning (interpretable) representations of (bounded)
  rationality—while naturally capturing intuitive notions of suboptimal actions, biased
  beliefs, and imperfect knowledge of environments.'
