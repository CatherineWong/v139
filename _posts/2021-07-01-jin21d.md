title: 'MOTS: Minimax Optimal Thompson Sampling'
abstract: Thompson sampling is one of the most widely used algorithms in many online
  decision problems due to its simplicity for implementation and superior empirical
  performance over other state-of-the-art methods. Despite its popularity and empirical
  success, it has remained an open problem whether Thompson sampling can achieve the
  minimax optimal regret O(\sqrt{TK}) for K-armed bandit problems, where T is the
  total time horizon. In this paper we fill this long open gap by proposing a new
  Thompson sampling algorithm called MOTS that adaptively truncates the sampling result
  of the chosen arm at each time step. We prove that this simple variant of Thompson
  sampling achieves the minimax optimal regret bound O(\sqrt{TK}) for finite time
  horizon T and also the asymptotic optimal regret bound when $T$ grows to infinity
  as well. This is the first time that the minimax optimality of multi-armed bandit
  problems has been attained by Thompson sampling type of algorithms.
