title: Learning Representations by Humans, for Humans
abstract: When machine predictors can achieve higher performance than the human decision-makers
  they support, improving the performance of human decision-makers is often conflated
  with improving machine accuracy. Here we propose a framework to directly support
  human decision-making, in which the role of machines is to reframe problems rather
  than to prescribe actions through prediction. Inspired by the success of representation
  learning in improving performance of machine predictors, our framework learns human-facing
  representations optimized for human performance. This “Mind Composed with Machine”
  framework incorporates a human decision-making model directly into the representation
  learning paradigm and is trained with a novel human-in-the-loop training procedure.
  We empirically demonstrate the successful application of the framework to various
  tasks and representational forms.
