title: Efficient Iterative Amortized Inference for Learning Symmetric and Disentangled
  Multi-Object Representations
abstract: 'Unsupervised multi-object representation learning depends on inductive
  biases to guide the discovery of object-centric representations that generalize.
  However, we observe that methods for learning these representations are either impractical
  due to long training times and large memory consumption or forego key inductive
  biases. In this work, we introduce EfficientMORL, an efficient framework for the
  unsupervised learning of object-centric representations. We show that optimization
  challenges caused by requiring both symmetry and disentanglement can in fact be
  addressed by high-cost iterative amortized inference by designing the framework
  to minimize its dependence on it. We take a two-stage approach to inference: first,
  a hierarchical variational autoencoder extracts symmetric and disentangled representations
  through bottom-up inference, and second, a lightweight network refines the representations
  with top-down feedback. The number of refinement steps taken during training is
  reduced following a curriculum, so that at test time with zero steps the model achieves
  99.1% of the refined decomposition performance. We demonstrate strong object decomposition
  and disentanglement on the standard multi-object benchmark while achieving nearly
  an order of magnitude faster training and test time inference over the previous
  state-of-the-art model.'
