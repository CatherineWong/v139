title: 'MC-LSTM: Mass-Conserving LSTM'
abstract: The success of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in computer vision is
  mainly driven by their strong inductive bias, which is strong enough to allow CNNs
  to solve vision-related tasks with random weights, meaning without learning. Similarly,
  Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) has a strong inductive bias towards storing information
  over time. However, many real-world systems are governed by conservation laws, which
  lead to the redistribution of particular quantities {â€”} e.g.in physical and economical
  systems. Our novel Mass-Conserving LSTM (MC-LSTM) adheres to these conservation
  laws by extending the inductive bias of LSTM to model the redistribution of those
  stored quantities. MC-LSTMs set a new state-of-the-art for neural arithmetic units
  at learning arithmetic operations, such as addition tasks,which have a strong conservation
  law, as the sum is constant over time. Further, MC-LSTM is applied to traffic forecasting,
  modeling a pendulum, and a large benchmark dataset in hydrology, where it sets a
  new state-of-the-art for predicting peak flows. In the hydrology example, we show
  that MC-LSTM states correlate with real world processes and are therefore interpretable.
