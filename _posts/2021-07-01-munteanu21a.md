title: Oblivious Sketching for Logistic Regression
abstract: What guarantees are possible for solving logistic regression in one pass
  over a data stream? To answer this question, we present the first data oblivious
  sketch for logistic regression. Our sketch can be computed in input sparsity time
  over a turnstile data stream and reduces the size of a $d$-dimensional data set
  from $n$ to only $\operatorname{poly}(\mu d\log n)$ weighted points, where $\mu$
  is a useful parameter which captures the complexity of compressing the data. Solving
  (weighted) logistic regression on the sketch gives an $O(\log n)$-approximation
  to the original problem on the full data set. We also show how to obtain an $O(1)$-approximation
  with slight modifications. Our sketches are fast, simple, easy to implement, and
  our experiments demonstrate their practicality.
