title: 'AutoSampling: Search for Effective Data Sampling Schedules'
abstract: Data sampling acts as a pivotal role in training deep learning models. However,
  an effective sampling schedule is difficult to learn due to its inherent high-dimension
  as a hyper-parameter. In this paper, we propose an AutoSampling method to automatically
  learn sampling schedules for model training, which consists of the multi-exploitation
  step aiming for optimal local sampling schedules and the exploration step for the
  ideal sampling distribution. More specifically, we achieve sampling schedule search
  with shortened exploitation cycle to provide enough supervision. In addition, we
  periodically estimate the sampling distribution from the learned sampling schedules
  and perturb it to search in the distribution space. The combination of two searches
  allows us to learn a robust sampling schedule. We apply our AutoSampling method
  to a variety of image classification tasks illustrating the effectiveness of the
  proposed method.
