title: Joint Online Learning and Decision-making via Dual Mirror Descent
abstract: We consider an online revenue maximization problem over a finite time horizon
  subject to lower and upper bounds on cost. At each period, an agent receives a context
  vector sampled i.i.d. from an unknown distribution and needs to make a decision
  adaptively. The revenue and cost functions depend on the context vector as well
  as some fixed but possibly unknown parameter vector to be learned. We propose a
  novel offline benchmark and a new algorithm that mixes an online dual mirror descent
  scheme with a generic parameter learning process. When the parameter vector is known,
  we demonstrate an $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret result as well an $O(\sqrt{T})$ bound on
  the possible constraint violations. When the parameter is not known and must be
  learned, we demonstrate that the regret and constraint violations are the sums of
  the previous $O(\sqrt{T})$ terms plus terms that directly depend on the convergence
  of the learning process.
