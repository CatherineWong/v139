title: Unsupervised Embedding Adaptation via Early-Stage Feature Reconstruction for
  Few-Shot Classification
abstract: We propose unsupervised embedding adaptation for the downstream few-shot
  classification task. Based on findings that deep neural networks learn to generalize
  before memorizing, we develop Early-Stage Feature Reconstruction (ESFR) — a novel
  adaptation scheme with feature reconstruction and dimensionality-driven early stopping
  that finds generalizable features. Incorporating ESFR consistently improves the
  performance of baseline methods on all standard settings, including the recently
  proposed transductive method. ESFR used in conjunction with the transductive method
  further achieves state-of-the-art performance on mini-ImageNet, tiered-ImageNet,
  and CUB; especially with 1.2% 2.0% improvements in accuracy over the previous best
  performing method on 1-shot setting.
