title: 'Deep Adaptive Design: Amortizing Sequential Bayesian Experimental Design'
abstract: We introduce Deep Adaptive Design (DAD), a method for amortizing the cost
  of adaptive Bayesian experimental design that allows experiments to be run in real-time.
  Traditional sequential Bayesian optimal experimental design approaches require substantial
  computation at each stage of the experiment. This makes them unsuitable for most
  real-world applications, where decisions must typically be made quickly. DAD addresses
  this restriction by learning an amortized design network upfront and then using
  this to rapidly run (multiple) adaptive experiments at deployment time. This network
  represents a design policy which takes as input the data from previous steps, and
  outputs the next design using a single forward pass; these design decisions can
  be made in milliseconds during the live experiment. To train the network, we introduce
  contrastive information bounds that are suitable objectives for the sequential setting,
  and propose a customized network architecture that exploits key symmetries. We demonstrate
  that DAD successfully amortizes the process of experimental design, outperforming
  alternative strategies on a number of problems.
