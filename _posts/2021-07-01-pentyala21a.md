title: Privacy-Preserving Video Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks
abstract: Many video classification applications require access to personal data,
  thereby posing an invasive security risk to the usersâ€™ privacy. We propose a privacy-preserving
  implementation of single-frame method based video classification with convolutional
  neural networks that allows a party to infer a label from a video without necessitating
  the video owner to disclose their video to other entities in an unencrypted manner.
  Similarly, our approach removes the requirement of the classifier owner from revealing
  their model parameters to outside entities in plaintext. To this end, we combine
  existing Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC) protocols for private image classification
  with our novel MPC protocols for oblivious single-frame selection and secure label
  aggregation across frames. The result is an end-to-end privacy-preserving video
  classification pipeline. We evaluate our proposed solution in an application for
  private human emotion recognition. Our results across a variety of security settings,
  spanning honest and dishonest majority configurations of the computing parties,
  and for both passive and active adversaries, demonstrate that videos can be classified
  with state-of-the-art accuracy, and without leaking sensitive user information.
