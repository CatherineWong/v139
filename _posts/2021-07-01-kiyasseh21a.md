title: 'CLOCS: Contrastive Learning of Cardiac Signals Across Space, Time, and Patients'
abstract: The healthcare industry generates troves of unlabelled physiological data.
  This data can be exploited via contrastive learning, a self-supervised pre-training
  method that encourages representations of instances to be similar to one another.
  We propose a family of contrastive learning methods, CLOCS, that encourages representations
  across space, time, \textit{and} patients to be similar to one another. We show
  that CLOCS consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, BYOL and SimCLR,
  when performing a linear evaluation of, and fine-tuning on, downstream tasks. We
  also show that CLOCS achieves strong generalization performance with only 25% of
  labelled training data. Furthermore, our training procedure naturally generates
  patient-specific representations that can be used to quantify patient-similarity.
