title: Training Data Subset Selection for Regression with Controlled Generalization
  Error
abstract: Data subset selection from a large number of training instances has been
  a successful approach toward efficient and cost-effective machine learning. However,
  models trained on a smaller subset may show poor generalization ability. In this
  paper, our goal is to design an algorithm for selecting a subset of the training
  data, so that the model can be trained quickly, without significantly sacrificing
  on accuracy. More specifically, we focus on data subset selection for $L_2$ regularized
  regression problems and provide a novel problem formulation which seeks to minimize
  the training loss with respect to both the trainable parameters and the subset of
  training data, subject to error bounds on the validation set. We tackle this problem
  using several technical innovations. First, we represent this problem with simplified
  constraints using the dual of the original training problem and show that the objective
  of this new representation is a monotone and $\alpha$-submodular function, for a
  wide variety of modeling choices. Such properties lead us to develop SELCON, an
  efficient majorization-minimization algorithm for data subset selection, that admits
  an approximation guarantee even when the training provides an imperfect estimate
  of the trained model. Finally, our experiments on several datasets show that SELCON
  trades off accuracy and efficiency more effectively than the current state-of-the-art.
