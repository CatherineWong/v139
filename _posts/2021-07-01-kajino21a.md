title: A Differentiable Point Process with Its Application to Spiking Neural Networks
abstract: This paper is concerned about a learning algorithm for a probabilistic model
  of spiking neural networks (SNNs). Jimenez Rezende & Gerstner (2014) proposed a
  stochastic variational inference algorithm to train SNNs with hidden neurons. The
  algorithm updates the variational distribution using the score function gradient
  estimator, whose high variance often impedes the whole learning algorithm. This
  paper presents an alternative gradient estimator for SNNs based on the path-wise
  gradient estimator. The main technical difficulty is a lack of a general method
  to differentiate a realization of an arbitrary point process, which is necessary
  to derive the path-wise gradient estimator. We develop a differentiable point process,
  which is the technical highlight of this paper, and apply it to derive the path-wise
  gradient estimator for SNNs. We investigate the effectiveness of our gradient estimator
  through numerical simulation.
