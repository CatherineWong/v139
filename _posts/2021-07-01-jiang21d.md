title: Approximation Theory of Convolutional Architectures for Time Series Modelling
abstract: We study the approximation properties of convolutional architectures applied
  to time series modelling, which can be formulated mathematically as a functional
  approximation problem. In the recurrent setting, recent results reveal an intricate
  connection between approximation efficiency and memory structures in the data generation
  process. In this paper, we derive parallel results for convolutional architectures,
  with WaveNet being a prime example. Our results reveal that in this new setting,
  approximation efficiency is not only characterised by memory, but also additional
  fine structures in the target relationship. This leads to a novel definition of
  spectrum-based regularity that measures the complexity of temporal relationships
  under the convolutional approximation scheme. These analyses provide a foundation
  to understand the differences between architectural choices for time series modelling
  and can give theoretically grounded guidance for practical applications.
