title: 'LieTransformer: Equivariant Self-Attention for Lie Groups'
abstract: 'Group equivariant neural networks are used as building blocks of group
  invariant neural networks, which have been shown to improve generalisation performance
  and data efficiency through principled parameter sharing. Such works have mostly
  focused on group equivariant convolutions, building on the result that group equivariant
  linear maps are necessarily convolutions. In this work, we extend the scope of the
  literature to self-attention, that is emerging as a prominent building block of
  deep learning models. We propose the LieTransformer, an architecture composed of
  LieSelfAttention layers that are equivariant to arbitrary Lie groups and their discrete
  subgroups. We demonstrate the generality of our approach by showing experimental
  results that are competitive to baseline methods on a wide range of tasks: shape
  counting on point clouds, molecular property regression and modelling particle trajectories
  under Hamiltonian dynamics.'
