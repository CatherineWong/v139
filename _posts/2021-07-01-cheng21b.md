title: Self-supervised and Supervised Joint Training for Resource-rich Machine Translation
abstract: Self-supervised pre-training of text representations has been successfully
  applied to low-resource Neural Machine Translation (NMT). However, it usually fails
  to achieve notable gains on resource-rich NMT. In this paper, we propose a joint
  training approach, F2-XEnDec, to combine self-supervised and supervised learning
  to optimize NMT models. To exploit complementary self-supervised signals for supervised
  learning, NMT models are trained on examples that are interbred from monolingual
  and parallel sentences through a new process called crossover encoder-decoder. Experiments
  on two resource-rich translation benchmarks, WMT’14 English-German and WMT’14 English-French,
  demonstrate that our approach achieves substantial improvements over several strong
  baseline methods and obtains a new state of the art of 46.19 BLEU on English-French
  when incorporating back translation. Results also show that our approach is capable
  of improving model robustness to input perturbations such as code-switching noise
  which frequently appears on the social media.
