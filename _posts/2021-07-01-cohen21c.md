title: Differentially-Private Clustering of Easy Instances
abstract: Clustering is a fundamental problem in data analysis. In differentially
  private clustering, the goal is to identify k cluster centers without disclosing
  information on individual data points. Despite significant research progress, the
  problem had so far resisted practical solutions. In this work we aim at providing
  simple implementable differentrially private clustering algorithms when the the
  data is "easy," e.g., when there exists a significant separation between the clusters.
  For the easy instances we consider, we have a simple implementation based on utilizing
  non-private clustering algorithms, and combining them privately. We are able to
  get improved sample complexity bounds in some cases of Gaussian mixtures and k-means.
  We complement our theoretical algorithms with experiments of simulated data.
