title: Integer Programming for Causal Structure Learning in the Presence of Latent
  Variables
abstract: The problem of finding an ancestral acyclic directed mixed graph (ADMG)
  that represents the causal relationships between a set of variables is an important
  area of research on causal inference. Most existing score-based structure learning
  methods focus on learning directed acyclic graph (DAG) models without latent variables.
  A number of score-based methods have recently been proposed for the ADMG learning,
  yet they are heuristic in nature and do not guarantee an optimal solution. We propose
  a novel exact score-based method that solves an integer programming (IP) formulation
  and returns a score-maximizing ancestral ADMG for a set of continuous variables
  that follow a multivariate Gaussian distribution. We generalize the state-of-the-art
  IP model for DAG learning problems and derive new classes of valid inequalities
  to formulate an IP model for ADMG learning. Empirically, our model can be solved
  efficiently for medium-sized problems and achieves better accuracy than state-of-the-art
  score-based methods as well as benchmark constraint-based methods.
