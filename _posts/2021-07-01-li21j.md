title: Approximate Group Fairness for Clustering
abstract: 'We incorporate group fairness into the algorithmic centroid clustering
  problem, where $k$ centers are to be located to serve $n$ agents distributed in
  a metric space. We refine the notion of proportional fairness proposed in [Chen
  et al., ICML 2019] as {\em core fairness}. A $k$-clustering is in the core if no
  coalition containing at least $n/k$ agents can strictly decrease their total distance
  by deviating to a new center together. Our solution concept is motivated by the
  situation where agents are able to coordinate and utilities are transferable. A
  string of existence, hardness and approximability results is provided. Particularly,
  we propose two dimensions to relax core requirements: one is on the degree of distance
  improvement, and the other is on the size of deviating coalition. For both relaxations
  and their combination, we study the extent to which relaxed core fairness can be
  satisfied in metric spaces including line, tree and general metric space, and design
  approximation algorithms accordingly. We also conduct experiments on synthetic and
  real-world data to examine the performance of our algorithms.'
