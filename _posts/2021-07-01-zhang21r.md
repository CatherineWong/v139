title: Differentiable Dynamic Quantization with Mixed Precision and Adaptive Resolution
abstract: Model quantization is challenging due to many tedious hyper-parameters such
  as precision (bitwidth), dynamic range (minimum and maximum discrete values) and
  stepsize (interval between discrete values). Unlike prior arts that carefully tune
  these values, we present a fully differentiable approach to learn all of them, named
  Differentiable Dynamic Quantization (DDQ), which has several benefits. (1) DDQ is
  able to quantize challenging lightweight architectures like MobileNets, where different
  layers prefer different quantization parameters. (2) DDQ is hardware-friendly and
  can be easily implemented using low-precision matrix-vector multiplication, making
  it capable in many hardware such as ARM. (3) Extensive experiments show that DDQ
  outperforms prior arts on many networks and benchmarks, especially when models are
  already efficient and compact. e.g., DDQ is the first approach that achieves lossless
  4-bit quantization for MobileNetV2 on ImageNet.
