title: Value Iteration in Continuous Actions, States and Time
abstract: Classical value iteration approaches are not applicable to environments
  with continuous states and actions. For such environments the states and actions
  must be discretized, which leads to an exponential increase in computational complexity.
  In this paper, we propose continuous fitted value iteration (cFVI). This algorithm
  enables dynamic programming for continuous states and actions with a known dynamics
  model. Exploiting the continuous time formulation, the optimal policy can be derived
  for non-linear control-affine dynamics. This closed-form solution enables the efficient
  extension of value iteration to continuous environments. We show in non-linear control
  experiments that the dynamic programming solution obtains the same quantitative
  performance as deep reinforcement learning methods in simulation but excels when
  transferred to the physical system.The policy obtained by cFVI is more robust to
  changes in the dynamics despite using only a deterministic model and without explicitly
  incorporating robustness in the optimization
