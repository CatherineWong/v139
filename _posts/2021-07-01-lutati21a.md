title: HyperHyperNetwork for the Design of Antenna Arrays
abstract: We present deep learning methods for the design of arrays and single instances
  of small antennas. Each design instance is conditioned on a target radiation pattern
  and is required to conform to specific spatial dimensions and to include, as part
  of its metallic structure, a set of predetermined locations. The solution, in the
  case of a single antenna, is based on a composite neural network that combines a
  simulation network, a hypernetwork, and a refinement network. In the design of the
  antenna array, we add an additional design level and employ a hypernetwork within
  a hypernetwork. The learning objective is based on measuring the similarity of the
  obtained radiation pattern to the desired one. Our experiments demonstrate that
  our approach is able to design novel antennas and antenna arrays that are compliant
  with the design requirements, considerably better than the baseline methods. We
  compare the solutions obtained by our method to existing designs and demonstrate
  a high level of overlap. When designing the antenna array of a cellular phone, the
  obtained solution displays improved properties over the existing one.
