title: Towards Open Ad Hoc Teamwork Using Graph-based Policy Learning
abstract: Ad hoc teamwork is the challenging problem of designing an autonomous agent
  which can adapt quickly to collaborate with teammates without prior coordination
  mechanisms, including joint training. Prior work in this area has focused on closed
  teams in which the number of agents is fixed. In this work, we consider open teams
  by allowing agents with different fixed policies to enter and leave the environment
  without prior notification. Our solution builds on graph neural networks to learn
  agent models and joint-action value models under varying team compositions. We contribute
  a novel action-value computation that integrates the agent model and joint-action
  value model to produce action-value estimates. We empirically demonstrate that our
  approach successfully models the effects other agents have on the learner, leading
  to policies that robustly adapt to dynamic team compositions and significantly outperform
  several alternative methods.
