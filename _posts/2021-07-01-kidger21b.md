title: Neural SDEs as Infinite-Dimensional GANs
abstract: Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) are a staple of mathematical modelling
  of temporal dynamics. However, a fundamental limitation has been that such models
  have typically been relatively inflexible, which recent work introducing Neural
  SDEs has sought to solve. Here, we show that the current classical approach to fitting
  SDEs may be approached as a special case of (Wasserstein) GANs, and in doing so
  the neural and classical regimes may be brought together. The input noise is Brownian
  motion, the output samples are time-evolving paths produced by a numerical solver,
  and by parameterising a discriminator as a Neural Controlled Differential Equation
  (CDE), we obtain Neural SDEs as (in modern machine learning parlance) continuous-time
  generative time series models. Unlike previous work on this problem, this is a direct
  extension of the classical approach without reference to either prespecified statistics
  or density functions. Arbitrary drift and diffusions are admissible, so as the Wasserstein
  loss has a unique global minima, in the infinite data limit \textit{any} SDE may
  be learnt.
