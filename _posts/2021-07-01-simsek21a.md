title: 'Geometry of the Loss Landscape in Overparameterized Neural Networks: Symmetries
  and Invariances'
abstract: 'We study how permutation symmetries in overparameterized multi-layer neural
  networks generate ‘symmetry-induced’ critical points. Assuming a network with $
  L $ layers of minimal widths $ r_1^*, \ldots, r_{L-1}^* $ reaches a zero-loss minimum
  at $ r_1^*! \cdots r_{L-1}^*! $ isolated points that are permutations of one another,
  we show that adding one extra neuron to each layer is sufficient to connect all
  these previously discrete minima into a single manifold. For a two-layer overparameterized
  network of width $ r^*+ h =: m $ we explicitly describe the manifold of global minima:
  it consists of $ T(r^*, m) $ affine subspaces of dimension at least $ h $ that are
  connected to one another. For a network of width $m$, we identify the number $G(r,m)$
  of affine subspaces containing only symmetry-induced critical points that are related
  to the critical points of a smaller network of width $r<r^*$. Via a combinatorial
  analysis, we derive closed-form formulas for $ T $ and $ G $ and show that the number
  of symmetry-induced critical subspaces dominates the number of affine subspaces
  forming the global minima manifold in the mildly overparameterized regime (small
  $ h $) and vice versa in the vastly overparameterized regime ($h \gg r^*$). Our
  results provide new insights into the minimization of the non-convex loss function
  of overparameterized neural networks.'
