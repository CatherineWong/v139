title: On Energy-Based Models with Overparametrized Shallow Neural Networks
abstract: Energy-based models (EBMs) are a simple yet powerful framework for generative
  modeling. They are based on a trainable energy function which defines an associated
  Gibbs measure, and they can be trained and sampled from via well-established statistical
  tools, such as MCMC. Neural networks may be used as energy function approximators,
  providing both a rich class of expressive models as well as a flexible device to
  incorporate data structure. In this work we focus on shallow neural networks. Building
  from the incipient theory of overparametrized neural networks, we show that models
  trained in the so-called ’active’ regime provide a statistical advantage over their
  associated ’lazy’ or kernel regime, leading to improved adaptivity to hidden low-dimensional
  structure in the data distribution, as already observed in supervised learning.
  Our study covers both the maximum likelihood and Stein Discrepancy estimators, and
  we validate our theoretical results with numerical experiments on synthetic data.
