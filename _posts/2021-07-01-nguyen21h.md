title: Temporal Predictive Coding For Model-Based Planning In Latent Space
abstract: High-dimensional observations are a major challenge in the application of
  model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) to real-world environments. To handle
  high-dimensional sensory inputs, existing approaches use representation learning
  to map high-dimensional observations into a lower-dimensional latent space that
  is more amenable to dynamics estimation and planning. In this work, we present an
  information-theoretic approach that employs temporal predictive coding to encode
  elements in the environment that can be predicted across time. Since this approach
  focuses on encoding temporally-predictable information, we implicitly prioritize
  the encoding of task-relevant components over nuisance information within the environment
  that are provably task-irrelevant. By learning this representation in conjunction
  with a recurrent state space model, we can then perform planning in latent space.
  We evaluate our model on a challenging modification of standard DMControl tasks
  where the background is replaced with natural videos that contain complex but irrelevant
  information to the planning task. Our experiments show that our model is superior
  to existing methods in the challenging complex-background setting while remaining
  competitive with current state-of-the-art models in the standard setting.
