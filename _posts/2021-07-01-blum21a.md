title: 'One for One, or All for All: Equilibria and Optimality of Collaboration in
  Federated Learning'
abstract: In recent years, federated learning has been embraced as an approach for
  bringing about collaboration across large populations of learning agents. However,
  little is known about how collaboration protocols should take agents’ incentives
  into account when allocating individual resources for communal learning in order
  to maintain such collaborations. Inspired by game theoretic notions, this paper
  introduces a framework for incentive-aware learning and data sharing in federated
  learning. Our stable and envy-free equilibria capture notions of collaboration in
  the presence of agents interested in meeting their learning objectives while keeping
  their own sample collection burden low. For example, in an envy-free equilibrium,
  no agent would wish to swap their sampling burden with any other agent and in a
  stable equilibrium, no agent would wish to unilaterally reduce their sampling burden.
  In addition to formalizing this framework, our contributions include characterizing
  the structural properties of such equilibria, proving when they exist, and showing
  how they can be computed. Furthermore, we compare the sample complexity of incentive-aware
  collaboration with that of optimal collaboration when one ignores agents’ incentives.
