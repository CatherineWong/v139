title: Active Learning for Distributionally Robust Level-Set Estimation
abstract: Many cases exist in which a black-box function $f$ with high evaluation
  cost depends on two types of variables $\bm x$ and $\bm w$, where $\bm x$ is a controllable
  \emph{design} variable and $\bm w$ are uncontrollable \emph{environmental} variables
  that have random variation following a certain distribution $P$. In such cases,
  an important task is to find the range of design variables $\bm x$ such that the
  function $f(\bm x, \bm w)$ has the desired properties by incorporating the random
  variation of the environmental variables $\bm w$. A natural measure of robustness
  is the probability that $f(\bm x, \bm w)$ exceeds a given threshold $h$, which is
  known as the \emph{probability threshold robustness} (PTR) measure in the literature
  on robust optimization. However, this robustness measure cannot be correctly evaluated
  when the distribution $P$ is unknown. In this study, we addressed this problem by
  considering the \textit{distributionally robust PTR} (DRPTR) measure, which considers
  the worst-case PTR within given candidate distributions. Specifically, we studied
  the problem of efficiently identifying a reliable set $H$, which is defined as a
  region in which the DRPTR measure exceeds a certain desired probability $\alpha$,
  which can be interpreted as a level set estimation (LSE) problem for DRPTR. We propose
  a theoretically grounded and computationally efficient active learning method for
  this problem. We show that the proposed method has theoretical guarantees on convergence
  and accuracy, and confirmed through numerical experiments that the proposed method
  outperforms existing methods.
