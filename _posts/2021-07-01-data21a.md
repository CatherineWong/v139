title: Byzantine-Resilient High-Dimensional SGD with Local Iterations on Heterogeneous
  Data
abstract: We study stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with local iterations in the
  presence of Byzantine clients, motivated by the federated learning. The clients,
  instead of communicating with the server in every iteration, maintain their local
  models, which they update by taking several SGD iterations based on their own datasets
  and then communicate the net update with the server, thereby achieving communication-efficiency.
  Furthermore, only a subset of clients communicates with the server at synchronization
  times. The Byzantine clients may collude and send arbitrary vectors to the server
  to disrupt the learning process. To combat the adversary, we employ an efficient
  high-dimensional robust mean estimation algorithm at the server to filter-out corrupt
  vectors; and to analyze the outlier-filtering procedure, we develop a novel matrix
  concentration result that may be of independent interest. We provide convergence
  analyses for both strongly-convex and non-convex smooth objectives in the heterogeneous
  data setting. We believe that ours is the first Byzantine-resilient local SGD algorithm
  and analysis with non-trivial guarantees. We corroborate our theoretical results
  with preliminary experiments for neural network training.
