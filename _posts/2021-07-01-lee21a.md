title: 'Sharing Less is More: Lifelong Learning in Deep Networks with Selective Layer
  Transfer'
abstract: Effective lifelong learning across diverse tasks requires the transfer of
  diverse knowledge, yet transferring irrelevant knowledge may lead to interference
  and catastrophic forgetting. In deep networks, transferring the appropriate granularity
  of knowledge is as important as the transfer mechanism, and must be driven by the
  relationships among tasks. We first show that the lifelong learning performance
  of several current deep learning architectures can be significantly improved by
  transfer at the appropriate layers. We then develop an expectation-maximization
  (EM) method to automatically select the appropriate transfer configuration and optimize
  the task network weights. This EM-based selective transfer is highly effective,
  balancing transfer performance on all tasks with avoiding catastrophic forgetting,
  as demonstrated on three algorithms in several lifelong object classification scenarios.
