title: Distributionally Robust Optimization with Markovian Data
abstract: We study a stochastic program where the probability distribution of the
  uncertain problem parameters is unknown and only indirectly observed via finitely
  many correlated samples generated by an unknown Markov chain with $d$ states. We
  propose a data-driven distributionally robust optimization model to estimate the
  problemâ€™s objective function and optimal solution. By leveraging results from large
  deviations theory, we derive statistical guarantees on the quality of these estimators.
  The underlying worst-case expectation problem is nonconvex and involves $\mathcal
  O(d^2)$ decision variables. Thus, it cannot be solved efficiently for large $d$.
  By exploiting the structure of this problem, we devise a customized Frank-Wolfe
  algorithm with convex direction-finding subproblems of size $\mathcal O(d)$. We
  prove that this algorithm finds a stationary point efficiently under mild conditions.
  The efficiency of the method is predicated on a dimensionality reduction enabled
  by a dual reformulation. Numerical experiments indicate that our approach has better
  computational and statistical properties than the state-of-the-art methods.
