title: Temporally Correlated Task Scheduling for Sequence Learning
abstract: Sequence learning has attracted much research attention from the machine
  learning community in recent years. In many applications, a sequence learning task
  is usually associated with multiple temporally correlated auxiliary tasks, which
  are different in terms of how much input information to use or which future step
  to predict. For example, (i) in simultaneous machine translation, one can conduct
  translation under different latency (i.e., how many input words to read/wait before
  translation); (ii) in stock trend forecasting, one can predict the price of a stock
  in different future days (e.g., tomorrow, the day after tomorrow). While it is clear
  that those temporally correlated tasks can help each other, there is a very limited
  exploration on how to better leverage multiple auxiliary tasks to boost the performance
  of the main task. In this work, we introduce a learnable scheduler to sequence learning,
  which can adaptively select auxiliary tasks for training depending on the model
  status and the current training data. The scheduler and the model for the main task
  are jointly trained through bi-level optimization. Experiments show that our method
  significantly improves the performance of simultaneous machine translation and stock
  trend forecasting.
