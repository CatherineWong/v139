title: Model Fusion for Personalized Learning
abstract: Production systems operating on a growing domain of analytic services often
  require generating warm-start solution models for emerging tasks with limited data.
  One potential approach to address this warm-start challenge is to adopt meta learning
  to generate a base model that can be adapted to solve unseen tasks with minimal
  fine-tuning. This however requires the training processes of previous solution models
  of existing tasks to be synchronized. This is not possible if these models were
  pre-trained separately on private data owned by different entities and cannot be
  synchronously re-trained. To accommodate for such scenarios, we develop a new personalized
  learning framework that synthesizes customized models for unseen tasks via fusion
  of independently pre-trained models of related tasks. We establish performance guarantee
  for the proposed framework and demonstrate its effectiveness on both synthetic and
  real datasets.
