title: 'LTL2Action: Generalizing LTL Instructions for Multi-Task RL'
abstract: We address the problem of teaching a deep reinforcement learning (RL) agent
  to follow instructions in multi-task environments. Instructions are expressed in
  a well-known formal language {–} linear temporal logic (LTL) {–} and can specify
  a diversity of complex, temporally extended behaviours, including conditionals and
  alternative realizations. Our proposed learning approach exploits the compositional
  syntax and the semantics of LTL, enabling our RL agent to learn task-conditioned
  policies that generalize to new instructions, not observed during training. To reduce
  the overhead of learning LTL semantics, we introduce an environment-agnostic LTL
  pretraining scheme which improves sample-efficiency in downstream environments.
  Experiments on discrete and continuous domains target combinatorial task sets of
  up to $\sim10^{39}$ unique tasks and demonstrate the strength of our approach in
  learning to solve (unseen) tasks, given LTL instructions.
