title: Active Slices for Sliced Stein Discrepancy
abstract: 'Sliced Stein discrepancy (SSD) and its kernelized variants have demonstrated
  promising successes in goodness-of-fit tests and model learning in high dimensions.
  Despite the theoretical elegance, their empirical performance depends crucially
  on the search of the optimal slicing directions to discriminate between two distributions.
  Unfortunately, previous gradient-based optimisation approach returns sub-optimal
  results for the slicing directions: it is computationally expensive, sensitive to
  initialization, and it lacks theoretical guarantee for convergence. We address these
  issues in two steps. First, we show in theory that the requirement of using optimal
  slicing directions in the kernelized version of SSD can be relaxed, validating the
  resulting discrepancy with finite random slicing directions. Second, given that
  good slicing directions are crucial for practical performance, we propose a fast
  algorithm for finding good slicing directions based on ideas of active sub-space
  construction and spectral decomposition. Experiments in goodness-of-fit tests and
  model learning show that our approach achieves both the best performance and the
  fastest convergence. Especially, we demonstrate 14-80x speed-up in goodness-of-fit
  tests when compared with the gradient-based approach.'
