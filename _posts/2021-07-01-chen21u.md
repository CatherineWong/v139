title: Representation Subspace Distance for Domain Adaptation Regression
abstract: 'Regression, as a counterpart to classification, is a major paradigm with
  a wide range of applications. Domain adaptation regression extends it by generalizing
  a regressor from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Existing
  domain adaptation regression methods have achieved positive results limited only
  to the shallow regime. A question arises: Why learning invariant representations
  in the deep regime less pronounced? A key finding of this paper is that classification
  is robust to feature scaling but regression is not, and aligning the distributions
  of deep representations will alter feature scale and impede domain adaptation regression.
  Based on this finding, we propose to close the domain gap through orthogonal bases
  of the representation spaces, which are free from feature scaling. Inspired by Riemannian
  geometry of Grassmann manifold, we define a geometrical distance over representation
  subspaces and learn deep transferable representations by minimizing it. To avoid
  breaking the geometrical properties of deep representations, we further introduce
  the bases mismatch penalization to match the ordering of orthogonal bases across
  representation subspaces. Our method is evaluated on three domain adaptation regression
  benchmarks, two of which are introduced in this paper. Our method outperforms the
  state-of-the-art methods significantly, forming early positive results in the deep
  regime.'
