title: Marginal Contribution Feature Importance - an Axiomatic Approach for Explaining
  Data
abstract: In recent years, methods were proposed for assigning feature importance
  scores to measure the contribution of individual features. While in some cases the
  goal is to understand a specific model, in many cases the goal is to understand
  the contribution of certain properties (features) to a real-world phenomenon. Thus,
  a distinction has been made between feature importance scores that explain a model
  and scores that explain the data. When explaining the data, machine learning models
  are used as proxies in settings where conducting many real-world experiments is
  expensive or prohibited. While existing feature importance scores show great success
  in explaining models, we demonstrate their limitations when explaining the data,
  especially in the presence of correlations between features. Therefore, we develop
  a set of axioms to capture properties expected from a feature importance score when
  explaining data and prove that there exists only one score that satisfies all of
  them, the Marginal Contribution Feature Importance (MCI). We analyze the theoretical
  properties of this score function and demonstrate its merits empirically.
