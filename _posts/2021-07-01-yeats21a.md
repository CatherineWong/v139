title: Improving Gradient Regularization using Complex-Valued Neural Networks
abstract: Gradient regularization is a neural network defense technique that requires
  no prior knowledge of an adversarial attack and that brings only limited increase
  in training computational complexity. A form of complex-valued neural network (CVNN)
  is proposed to improve the performance of gradient regularization on classification
  tasks of real-valued input in adversarial settings. The activation derivatives of
  each layer of the CVNN are dependent on the combination of inputs to the layer,
  and locally stable representations can be learned for inputs the network is trained
  on. Furthermore, the properties of the CVNN parameter derivatives resist decrease
  of performance on the standard objective that is caused by competition with the
  gradient regularization objective. Experimental results show that the performance
  of gradient regularized CVNN surpasses that of real-valued neural networks with
  comparable storage and computational complexity. Moreover, gradient regularized
  complex-valued networks exhibit robust performance approaching that of real-valued
  networks trained with multi-step adversarial training.
