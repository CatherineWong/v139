title: Householder Sketch for Accurate and Accelerated Least-Mean-Squares Solvers
abstract: Least-Mean-Squares (\textsc{LMS}) solvers comprise a class of fundamental
  optimization problems such as linear regression, and regularized regressions such
  as Ridge, LASSO, and Elastic-Net. Data summarization techniques for big data generate
  summaries called coresets and sketches to speed up model learning under streaming
  and distributed settings. For example, \citep{nips2019} design a fast and accurate
  Caratheodory set on input data to boost the performance of existing \textsc{LMS}
  solvers. In retrospect, we explore classical Householder transformation as a candidate
  for sketching and accurately solving LMS problems. We find it to be a simpler, memory-efficient,
  and faster alternative that always existed to the above strong baseline. We also
  present a scalable algorithm based on the construction of distributed Householder
  sketches to solve \textsc{LMS} problem across multiple worker nodes. We perform
  thorough empirical analysis with large synthetic and real datasets to evaluate the
  performance of Householder sketch and compare with \citep{nips2019}. Our results
  show Householder sketch speeds up existing \textsc{LMS} solvers in the scikit-learn
  library up to $100$x-$400$x. Also, it is $10$x-$100$x faster than the above baseline
  with similar numerical stability. The distributed algorithm demonstrates linear
  scalability with a near-negligible communication overhead.
