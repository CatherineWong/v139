title: Compressed Maximum Likelihood
abstract: Maximum likelihood (ML) is one of the most fundamental and general statistical
  estimation techniques. Inspired by recent advances in estimating distribution functionals,
  we propose $\textit{compressed maximum likelihood}$ (CML) that applies ML to the
  compressed samples. We then show that CML is sample-efficient for several essential
  learning tasks over both discrete and continuous domains, including learning densities
  with structures, estimating probability multisets, and inferring symmetric distribution
  functionals.
