title: Neural Tangent Generalization Attacks
abstract: 'The remarkable performance achieved by Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in many
  applications is followed by the rising concern about data privacy and security.
  Since DNNs usually require large datasets to train, many practitioners scrape data
  from external sources such as the Internet. However, an external data owner may
  not be willing to let this happen, causing legal or ethical issues. In this paper,
  we study the generalization attacks against DNNs, where an attacker aims to slightly
  modify training data in order to spoil the training process such that a trained
  network lacks generalizability. These attacks can be performed by data owners and
  protect data from unexpected use. However, there is currently no efficient generalization
  attack against DNNs due to the complexity of a bilevel optimization involved. We
  propose the Neural Tangent Generalization Attack (NTGA) that, to the best of our
  knowledge, is the first work enabling clean-label, black-box generalization attack
  against DNNs. We conduct extensive experiments, and the empirical results demonstrate
  the effectiveness of NTGA. Our code and perturbed datasets are available at: https://github.com/lionelmessi6410/ntga.'
