title: Graph Neural Networks Inspired by Classical Iterative Algorithms
abstract: Despite the recent success of graph neural networks (GNN), common architectures
  often exhibit significant limitations, including sensitivity to oversmoothing, long-range
  dependencies, and spurious edges, e.g., as can occur as a result of graph heterophily
  or adversarial attacks. To at least partially address these issues within a simple
  transparent framework, we consider a new family of GNN layers designed to mimic
  and integrate the update rules of two classical iterative algorithms, namely, proximal
  gradient descent and iterative reweighted least squares (IRLS). The former defines
  an extensible base GNN architecture that is immune to oversmoothing while nonetheless
  capturing long-range dependencies by allowing arbitrary propagation steps. In contrast,
  the latter produces a novel attention mechanism that is explicitly anchored to an
  underlying end-to-end energy function, contributing stability with respect to edge
  uncertainty. When combined we obtain an extremely simple yet robust model that we
  evaluate across disparate scenarios including standardized benchmarks, adversarially-perturbated
  graphs, graphs with heterophily, and graphs involving long-range dependencies. In
  doing so, we compare against SOTA GNN approaches that have been explicitly designed
  for the respective task, achieving competitive or superior node classification accuracy.
