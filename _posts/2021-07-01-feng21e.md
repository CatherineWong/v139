title: Provably Correct Optimization and Exploration with Non-linear Policies
abstract: Policy optimization methods remain a powerful workhorse in empirical Reinforcement
  Learning (RL), with a focus on neural policies that can easily reason over complex
  and continuous state and/or action spaces. Theoretical understanding of strategic
  exploration in policy-based methods with non-linear function approximation, however,
  is largely missing. In this paper, we address this question by designing ENIAC,
  an actor-critic method that allows non-linear function approximation in the critic.
  We show that under certain assumptions, e.g., a bounded eluder dimension $d$ for
  the critic class, the learner finds to a near-optimal policy in $\widetilde{O}(\mathrm{poly}(d))$
  exploration rounds. The method is robust to model misspecification and strictly
  extends existing works on linear function approximation. We also develop some computational
  optimizations of our approach with slightly worse statistical guarantees, and an
  empirical adaptation building on existing deep RL tools. We empirically evaluate
  this adaptation, and show that it outperforms prior heuristics inspired by linear
  methods, establishing the value in correctly reasoning about the agentâ€™s uncertainty
  under non-linear function approximation.
