title: 'TFix: Learning to Fix Coding Errors with a Text-to-Text Transformer'
abstract: 'The problem of fixing errors in programs has attracted substantial interest
  over the years. The key challenge for building an effective code fixing tool is
  to capture a wide range of errors and meanwhile maintain high accuracy. In this
  paper, we address this challenge and present a new learning-based system, called
  TFix. TFix works directly on program text and phrases the problem of code fixing
  as a text-to-text task. In turn, this enables it to leverage a powerful Transformer
  based model pre-trained on natural language and fine-tuned to generate code fixes
  (via a large, high-quality dataset obtained from GitHub commits). TFix is not specific
  to a particular programming language or class of defects and, in fact, improved
  its precision by simultaneously fine-tuning on 52 different error types reported
  by a popular static analyzer. Our evaluation on a massive dataset of JavaScript
  programs shows that TFix is practically effective: it is able to synthesize code
  that fixes the error in Â 67 percent of cases and significantly outperforms existing
  learning-based approaches.'
