title: Strategic Classification Made Practical
abstract: Strategic classification regards the problem of learning in settings where
  users can strategically modify their features to improve outcomes. This setting
  applies broadly, and has received much recent attention. But despite its practical
  significance, work in this space has so far been predominantly theoretical. In this
  paper we present a learning framework for strategic classification that is practical.
  Our approach directly minimizes the “strategic” empirical risk, which we achieve
  by differentiating through the strategic response of users. This provides flexibility
  that allows us to extend beyond the original problem formulation and towards more
  realistic learning scenarios. A series of experiments demonstrates the effectiveness
  of our approach on various learning settings.
