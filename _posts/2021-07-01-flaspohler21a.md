title: Online Learning with Optimism and Delay
abstract: Inspired by the demands of real-time climate and weather forecasting, we
  develop optimistic online learning algorithms that require no parameter tuning and
  have optimal regret guarantees under delayed feedback. Our algorithms—DORM, DORM+,
  and AdaHedgeD—arise from a novel reduction of delayed online learning to optimistic
  online learning that reveals how optimistic hints can mitigate the regret penalty
  caused by delay. We pair this delay-as-optimism perspective with a new analysis
  of optimistic learning that exposes its robustness to hinting errors and a new meta-algorithm
  for learning effective hinting strategies in the presence of delay. We conclude
  by benchmarking our algorithms on four subseasonal climate forecasting tasks, demonstrating
  low regret relative to state-of-the-art forecasting models.
