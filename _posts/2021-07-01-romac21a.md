title: 'TeachMyAgent: a Benchmark for Automatic Curriculum Learning in Deep RL'
abstract: Training autonomous agents able to generalize to multiple tasks is a key
  target of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) research. In parallel to improving DRL
  algorithms themselves, Automatic Curriculum Learning (ACL) study how teacher algorithms
  can train DRL agents more efficiently by adapting task selection to their evolving
  abilities. While multiple standard benchmarks exist to compare DRL agents, there
  is currently no such thing for ACL algorithms. Thus, comparing existing approaches
  is difficult, as too many experimental parameters differ from paper to paper. In
  this work, we identify several key challenges faced by ACL algorithms. Based on
  these, we present TeachMyAgent (TA), a benchmark of current ACL algorithms leveraging
  procedural task generation. It includes 1) challenge-specific unit-tests using variants
  of a procedural Box2D bipedal walker environment, and 2) a new procedural Parkour
  environment combining most ACL challenges, making it ideal for global performance
  assessment. We then use TeachMyAgent to conduct a comparative study of representative
  existing approaches, showcasing the competitiveness of some ACL algorithms that
  do not use expert knowledge. We also show that the Parkour environment remains an
  open problem. We open-source our environments, all studied ACL algorithms (collected
  from open-source code or re-implemented), and DRL students in a Python package available
  at https://github.com/flowersteam/TeachMyAgent.
