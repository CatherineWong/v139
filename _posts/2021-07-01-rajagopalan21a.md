title: 'Hierarchical Clustering of Data Streams: Scalable Algorithms and Approximation
  Guarantees'
abstract: We investigate the problem of hierarchically clustering data streams containing
  metric data in R^d. We introduce a desirable invariance property for such algorithms,
  describe a general family of hyperplane-based methods enjoying this property, and
  analyze two scalable instances of this general family against recently popularized
  similarity/dissimilarity-based metrics for hierarchical clustering. We prove a number
  of new results related to the approximation ratios of these algorithms, improving
  in various ways over the literature on this subject. Finally, since our algorithms
  are principled but also very practical, we carry out an experimental comparison
  on both synthetic and real-world datasets showing competitive results against known
  baselines.
