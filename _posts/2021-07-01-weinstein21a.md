title: A Structured Observation Distribution for Generative Biological Sequence Prediction
  and Forecasting
abstract: 'Generative probabilistic modeling of biological sequences has widespread
  existing and potential application across biology and biomedicine, from evolutionary
  biology to epidemiology to protein design. Many standard sequence analysis methods
  preprocess data using a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) algorithm, one of the
  most widely used computational methods in all of science. However, as we show in
  this article, training generative probabilistic models with MSA preprocessing leads
  to statistical pathologies in the context of sequence prediction and forecasting.
  To address these problems, we propose a principled drop-in alternative to MSA preprocessing
  in the form of a structured observation distribution (the "MuE" distribution). We
  prove theoretically that the MuE distribution comprehensively generalizes popular
  methods for inferring biological sequence alignments, and provide a precise characterization
  of how such biological models have differed from natural language latent alignment
  models. We show empirically that models that use the MuE as an observation distribution
  outperform comparable methods across a variety of datasets, and apply MuE models
  to a novel problem for generative probabilistic sequence models: forecasting pathogen
  evolution.'
