title: Neural Symbolic Regression that scales
abstract: Symbolic equations are at the core of scientific discovery. The task of
  discovering the underlying equation from a set of input-output pairs is called symbolic
  regression. Traditionally, symbolic regression methods use hand-designed strategies
  that do not improve with experience. In this paper, we introduce the first symbolic
  regression method that leverages large scale pre-training. We procedurally generate
  an unbounded set of equations, and simultaneously pre-train a Transformer to predict
  the symbolic equation from a corresponding set of input-output-pairs. At test time,
  we query the model on a new set of points and use its output to guide the search
  for the equation. We show empirically that this approach can re-discover a set of
  well-known physical equations, and that it improves over time with more data and
  compute.
