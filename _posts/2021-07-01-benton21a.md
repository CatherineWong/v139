title: Loss Surface Simplexes for Mode Connecting Volumes and Fast Ensembling
abstract: With a better understanding of the loss surfaces for multilayer networks,
  we can build more robust and accurate training procedures. Recently it was discovered
  that independently trained SGD solutions can be connected along one-dimensional
  paths of near-constant training loss. In this paper, we in fact demonstrate the
  existence of mode-connecting simplicial complexes that form multi-dimensional manifolds
  of low loss, connecting many independently trained models. Building on this discovery,
  we show how to efficiently construct simplicial complexes for fast ensembling, outperforming
  independently trained deep ensembles in accuracy, calibration, and robustness to
  dataset shift. Notably, our approach is easy to apply and only requires a few training
  epochs to discover a low-loss simplex.
