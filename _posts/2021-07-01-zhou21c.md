title: Optimal Estimation of High Dimensional Smooth Additive Function Based on Noisy
  Observations
abstract: Given $\bx_j = \btheta + \bepsilon_j$, $j=1,...,n$ where $\btheta \in \RR^d$
  is an unknown parameter and $\bepsilon_j$ are i.i.d. Gaussian noise vectors, we
  study the estimation of $f(\btheta)$ for a given smooth function $f:\RR^d \rightarrow
  \RR$ equipped with an additive structure. We inherit the idea from a recent work
  which introduced an effective bias reduction technique through iterative bootstrap
  and derive a bias-reducing estimator. By establishing its normal approximation results,
  we show that the proposed estimator can achieve asymptotic normality with a looser
  constraint on smoothness compared with general smooth function due to the additive
  structure. Such results further imply that the proposed estimator is asymptotically
  efficient. Both upper and lower bounds on mean squared error are proved which shows
  the proposed estimator is minimax optimal for the smooth class considered. Numerical
  simulation results are presented to validate our analysis and show its superior
  performance of the proposed estimator over the plug-in approach in terms of bias
  reduction and building confidenceÂ intervals.
