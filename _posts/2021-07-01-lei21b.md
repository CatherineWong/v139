title: Stability and Generalization of Stochastic Gradient Methods for Minimax Problems
abstract: Many machine learning problems can be formulated as minimax problems such
  as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), AUC maximization and robust estimation,
  to mention but a few. A substantial amount of studies are devoted to studying the
  convergence behavior of their stochastic gradient-type algorithms. In contrast,
  there is relatively little work on understanding their generalization, i.e., how
  the learning models built from training examples would behave on test examples.
  In this paper, we provide a comprehensive generalization analysis of stochastic
  gradient methods for minimax problems under both convex-concave and nonconvex-nonconcave
  cases through the lens of algorithmic stability. We establish a quantitative connection
  between stability and several generalization measures both in expectation and with
  high probability. For the convex-concave setting, our stability analysis shows that
  stochastic gradient descent ascent attains optimal generalization bounds for both
  smooth and nonsmooth minimax problems. We also establish generalization bounds for
  both weakly-convex-weakly-concave and gradient-dominated problems. We report preliminary
  experimental results to verify our theory.
