title: 'PsiPhi-Learning: Reinforcement Learning with Demonstrations using Successor
  Features and Inverse Temporal Difference Learning'
abstract: We study reinforcement learning (RL) with no-reward demonstrations, a setting
  in which an RL agent has access to additional data from the interaction of other
  agents with the same environment. However, it has no access to the rewards or goals
  of these agents, and their objectives and levels of expertise may vary widely. These
  assumptions are common in multi-agent settings, such as autonomous driving. To effectively
  use this data, we turn to the framework of successor features. This allows us to
  disentangle shared features and dynamics of the environment from agent-specific
  rewards and policies. We propose a multi-task inverse reinforcement learning (IRL)
  algorithm, called \emph{inverse temporal difference learning} (ITD), that learns
  shared state features, alongside per-agent successor features and preference vectors,
  purely from demonstrations without reward labels. We further show how to seamlessly
  integrate ITD with learning from online environment interactions, arriving at a
  novel algorithm for reinforcement learning with demonstrations, called $\Psi \Phi$-learning
  (pronounced ‘Sci-Fi’). We provide empirical evidence for the effectiveness of $\Psi
  \Phi$-learning as a method for improving RL, IRL, imitation, and few-shot transfer,
  and derive worst-case bounds for its performance in zero-shot transfer to new tasks.
