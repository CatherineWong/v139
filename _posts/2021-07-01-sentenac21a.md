title: Pure Exploration and Regret Minimization in Matching Bandits
abstract: Finding an optimal matching in a weighted graph is a standard combinatorial
  problem. We consider its semi-bandit version where either a pair or a full matching
  is sampled sequentially. We prove that it is possible to leverage a rank-1 assumption
  on the adjacency matrix to reduce the sample complexity and the regret of off-the-shelf
  algorithms up to reaching a linear dependency in the number of vertices (up to to
  poly-log terms).
