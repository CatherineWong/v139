title: Message Passing Adaptive Resonance Theory for Online Active Semi-supervised
  Learning
abstract: Active learning is widely used to reduce labeling effort and training time
  by repeatedly querying only the most beneficial samples from unlabeled data. In
  real-world problems where data cannot be stored indefinitely due to limited storage
  or privacy issues, the query selection and the model update should be performed
  as soon as a new data sample is observed. Various online active learning methods
  have been studied to deal with these challenges; however, there are difficulties
  in selecting representative query samples and updating the model efficiently without
  forgetting. In this study, we propose Message Passing Adaptive Resonance Theory
  (MPART) that learns the distribution and topology of input data online. Through
  message passing on the topological graph, MPART actively queries informative and
  representative samples, and continuously improves the classification performance
  using both labeled and unlabeled data. We evaluate our model in stream-based selective
  sampling scenarios with comparable query selection strategies, showing that MPART
  significantly outperforms competitive models.
