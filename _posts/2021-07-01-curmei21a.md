title: Quantifying Availability and Discovery in Recommender Systems via Stochastic
  Reachability
abstract: In this work, we consider how preference models in interactive recommendation
  systems determine the availability of content and usersâ€™ opportunities for discovery.
  We propose an evaluation procedure based on stochastic reachability to quantify
  the maximum probability of recommending a target piece of content to an user for
  a set of allowable strategic modifications. This framework allows us to compute
  an upper bound on the likelihood of recommendation with minimal assumptions about
  user behavior. Stochastic reachability can be used to detect biases in the availability
  of content and diagnose limitations in the opportunities for discovery granted to
  users. We show that this metric can be computed efficiently as a convex program
  for a variety of practical settings, and further argue that reachability is not
  inherently at odds with accuracy. We demonstrate evaluations of recommendation algorithms
  trained on large datasets of explicit and implicit ratings. Our results illustrate
  how preference models, selection rules, and user interventions impact reachability
  and how these effects can be distributed unevenly.
