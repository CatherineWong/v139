title: CountSketches, Feature Hashing and the Median of Three
abstract: In this paper, we revisit the classic CountSketch method, which is a sparse,
  random projection that transforms a (high-dimensional) Euclidean vector $v$ to a
  vector of dimension $(2t-1) s$, where $t, s > 0$ are integer parameters. It is known
  that a CountSketch allows estimating coordinates of $v$ with variance bounded by
  $\|v\|_2^2/s$. For $t > 1$, the estimator takes the median of $2t-1$ independent
  estimates, and the probability that the estimate is off by more than $2 \|v\|_2/\sqrt{s}$
  is exponentially small in $t$. This suggests choosing $t$ to be logarithmic in a
  desired inverse failure probability. However, implementations of CountSketch often
  use a small, constant $t$. Previous work only predicts a constant factor improvement
  in this setting. Our main contribution is a new analysis of CountSketch, showing
  an improvement in variance to $O(\min\{\|v\|_1^2/s^2,\|v\|_2^2/s\})$ when $t > 1$.
  That is, the variance decreases proportionally to $s^{-2}$, asymptotically for large
  enough $s$.
