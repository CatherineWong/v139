title: Reinforcement Learning of Implicit and Explicit Control Flow Instructions
abstract: 'Learning to flexibly follow task instructions in dynamic environments poses
  interesting challenges for reinforcement learning agents. We focus here on the problem
  of learning control flow that deviates from a strict step-by-step execution of instructions{—}that
  is, control flow that may skip forward over parts of the instructions or return
  backward to previously completed or skipped steps. Demand for such flexible control
  arises in two fundamental ways: explicitly when control is specified in the instructions
  themselves (such as conditional branching and looping) and implicitly when stochastic
  environment dynamics require re-completion of instructions whose effects have been
  perturbed, or opportunistic skipping of instructions whose effects are already present.
  We formulate an attention-based architecture that meets these challenges by learning,
  from task reward only, to flexibly attend to and condition behavior on an internal
  encoding of the instructions. We test the architecture’s ability to learn both explicit
  and implicit control in two illustrative domains—one inspired by Minecraft and the
  other by StarCraft—and show that the architecture exhibits zero-shot generalization
  to novel instructions of length greater than those in a training set, at a performance
  level unmatched by three baseline recurrent architectures and one ablation architecture.'
