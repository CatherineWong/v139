title: Safe Reinforcement Learning Using Advantage-Based Intervention
abstract: Many sequential decision problems involve finding a policy that maximizes
  total reward while obeying safety constraints. Although much recent research has
  focused on the development of safe reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms that produce
  a safe policy after training, ensuring safety during training as well remains an
  open problem. A fundamental challenge is performing exploration while still satisfying
  constraints in an unknown Markov decision process (MDP). In this work, we address
  this problem for the chance-constrained setting.We propose a new algorithm, SAILR,
  that uses an intervention mechanism based on advantage functions to keep the agent
  safe throughout training and optimizes the agentâ€™s policy using off-the-shelf RL
  algorithms designed for unconstrained MDPs. Our method comes with strong guarantees
  on safety during "both" training and deployment (i.e., after training and without
  the intervention mechanism) and policy performance compared to the optimal safety-constrained
  policy. In our experiments, we show that SAILR violates constraints far less during
  training than standard safe RL and constrained MDP approaches and converges to a
  well-performing policy that can be deployed safely without intervention. Our code
  is available at https://github.com/nolanwagener/safe_rl.
