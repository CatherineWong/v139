title: Estimating $α$-Rank from A Few Entries with Low Rank Matrix Completion
abstract: 'Multi-agent evaluation aims at the assessment of an agent’s strategy on
  the basis of interaction with others. Typically, existing methods such as $\alpha$-rank
  and its approximation still require to exhaustively compare all pairs of joint strategies
  for an accurate ranking, which in practice is computationally expensive. In this
  paper, we aim to reduce the number of pairwise comparisons in recovering a satisfying
  ranking for $n$ strategies in two-player meta-games, by exploring the fact that
  agents with similar skills may achieve similar payoffs against others. Two situations
  are considered: the first one is when we can obtain the true payoffs; the other
  one is when we can only access noisy payoff. Based on these formulations, we leverage
  low-rank matrix completion and design two novel algorithms for noise-free and noisy
  evaluations respectively. For both of these settings, we theorize that $O(nr \log
  n)$ ($n$ is the number of agents and $r$ is the rank of the payoff matrix) payoff
  entries are required to achieve sufficiently well strategy evaluation performance.
  Empirical results on evaluating the strategies in three synthetic games and twelve
  real world games demonstrate that strategy evaluation from a few entries can lead
  to comparable performance to algorithms with full knowledge of the payoff matrix.'
