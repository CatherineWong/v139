title: Marginalized Stochastic Natural Gradients for Black-Box Variational Inference
abstract: Black-box variational inference algorithms use stochastic sampling to analyze
  diverse statistical models, like those expressed in probabilistic programming languages,
  without model-specific derivations. While the popular score-function estimator computes
  unbiased gradient estimates, its variance is often unacceptably large, especially
  in models with discrete latent variables. We propose a stochastic natural gradient
  estimator that is as broadly applicable and unbiased, but improves efficiency by
  exploiting the curvature of the variational bound, and provably reduces variance
  by marginalizing discrete latent variables. Our marginalized stochastic natural
  gradients have intriguing connections to classic coordinate ascent variational inference,
  but allow parallel updates of variational parameters, and provide superior convergence
  guarantees relative to naive Monte Carlo approximations. We integrate our method
  with the probabilistic programming language Pyro and evaluate real-world models
  of documents, images, networks, and crowd-sourcing. Compared to score-function estimators,
  we require far fewer Monte Carlo samples and consistently convergence orders of
  magnitude faster.
