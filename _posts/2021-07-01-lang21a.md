title: Graph Cuts Always Find a Global Optimum for Potts Models (With a Catch)
abstract: 'We prove that the alpha-expansion algorithm for MAP inference always returns
  a globally optimal assignment for Markov Random Fields with Potts pairwise potentials,
  with a catch: the returned assignment is only guaranteed to be optimal for an instance
  within a small perturbation of the original problem instance. In other words, all
  local minima with respect to expansion moves are global minima to slightly perturbed
  versions of the problem. On "real-world" instances, MAP assignments of small perturbations
  of the problem should be very similar to the MAP assignment(s) of the original problem
  instance. We design an algorithm that can certify whether this is the case in practice.
  On several MAP inference problem instances from computer vision, this algorithm
  certifies that MAP solutions to all of these perturbations are very close to solutions
  of the original instance. These results taken together give a cohesive explanation
  for the good performance of "graph cuts" algorithms in practice. Every local expansion
  minimum is a global minimum in a small perturbation of the problem, and all of these
  global minima are close to the original solution.'
