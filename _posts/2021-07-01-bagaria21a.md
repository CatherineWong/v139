title: Skill Discovery for Exploration and Planning using Deep Skill Graphs
abstract: We introduce a new skill-discovery algorithm that builds a discrete graph
  representation of large continuous MDPs, where nodes correspond to skill subgoals
  and the edges to skill policies. The agent constructs this graph during an unsupervised
  training phase where it interleaves discovering skills and planning using them to
  gain coverage over ever-increasing portions of the state-space. Given a novel goal
  at test time, the agent plans with the acquired skill graph to reach a nearby state,
  then switches to learning to reach the goal. We show that the resulting algorithm,
  Deep Skill Graphs, outperforms both flat and existing hierarchical reinforcement
  learning methods on four difficult continuous control tasks.
