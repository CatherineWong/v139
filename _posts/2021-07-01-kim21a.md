title: Improving Predictors via Combination Across Diverse Task Categories
abstract: Predictor combination is the problem of improving a task predictor using
  predictors of other tasks when the forms of individual predictors are unknown. Previous
  work approached this problem by nonparametrically assessing predictor relationships
  based on their joint evaluations on a shared sample. This limits their application
  to cases where all predictors are defined on the same task category, e.g. all predictors
  estimate attributes of shoes. We present a new predictor combination algorithm that
  overcomes this limitation. Our algorithm aligns the heterogeneous domains of different
  predictors in a shared latent space to facilitate comparisons of predictors independently
  of the domains on which they are originally defined. We facilitate this by a new
  data alignment scheme that matches data distributions across task categories. Based
  on visual attribute ranking experiments on datasets that span diverse task categories
  (e.g. shoes and animals), we demonstrate that our approach often significantly improves
  the performances of the initial predictors.
