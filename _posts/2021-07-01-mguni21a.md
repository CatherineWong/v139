title: Learning in Nonzero-Sum Stochastic Games with Potentials
abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has become effective in tackling
  discrete cooperative game scenarios. However, MARL has yet to penetrate settings
  beyond those modelled by team and zero-sum games, confining it to a small subset
  of multi-agent systems. In this paper, we introduce a new generation of MARL learners
  that can handle \textit{nonzero-sum} payoff structures and continuous settings.
  In particular, we study the MARL problem in a class of games known as stochastic
  potential games (SPGs) with continuous state-action spaces. Unlike cooperative games,
  in which all agents share a common reward, SPGs are capable of modelling real-world
  scenarios where agents seek to fulfil their individual goals. We prove theoretically
  our learning method, $\ourmethod$, enables independent agents to learn Nash equilibrium
  strategies in \textit{polynomial time}. We demonstrate our framework tackles previously
  unsolvable tasks such as \textit{Coordination Navigation} and \textit{large selfish
  routing games} and that it outperforms the state of the art MARL baselines such
  as MADDPG and COMIX in such scenarios.
