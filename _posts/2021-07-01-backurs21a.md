title: Faster Kernel Matrix Algebra via Density Estimation
abstract: We study fast algorithms for computing basic properties of an n x n positive
  semidefinite kernel matrix K corresponding to n points x_1,...,x_n in R^d. In particular,
  we consider the estimating the sum of kernel matrix entries, along with its top
  eigenvalue and eigenvector. These are some of the most basic problems defined over
  kernel matrices. We show that the sum of matrix entries can be estimated up to a
  multiplicative factor of 1+\epsilon in time sublinear in n and linear in d for many
  popular kernel functions, including the Gaussian, exponential, and rational quadratic
  kernels. For these kernels, we also show that the top eigenvalue (and a witnessing
  approximate eigenvector) can be approximated to a multiplicative factor of 1+\epsilon
  in time sub-quadratic in n and linear in d. Our algorithms represent significant
  advances in the best known runtimes for these problems. They leverage the positive
  definiteness of the kernel matrix, along with a recent line of work on efficient
  kernel density estimation.
