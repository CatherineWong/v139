title: Image-Level or Object-Level? A Tale of Two Resampling Strategies for Long-Tailed
  Detection
abstract: 'Training on datasets with long-tailed distributions has been challenging
  for major recognition tasks such as classification and detection. To deal with this
  challenge, image resampling is typically introduced as a simple but effective approach.
  However, we observe that long-tailed detection differs from classification since
  multiple classes may be present in one image. As a result, image resampling alone
  is not enough to yield a sufficiently balanced distribution at the object-level.
  We address object-level resampling by introducing an object-centric sampling strategy
  based on a dynamic, episodic memory bank. Our proposed strategy has two benefits:
  1) convenient object-level resampling without significant extra computation, and
  2) implicit feature-level augmentation from model updates. We show that image-level
  and object-level resamplings are both important, and thus unify them with a joint
  resampling strategy. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the rare
  categories of LVIS, with 1.89% and 3.13% relative improvements over Forest R-CNN
  on detection and instance segmentation.'
