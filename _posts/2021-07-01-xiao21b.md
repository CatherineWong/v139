title: On the Optimality of Batch Policy Optimization Algorithms
abstract: Batch policy optimization considers leveraging existing data for policy
  construction before interacting with an environment. Although interest in this problem
  has grown significantly in recent years, its theoretical foundations remain under-developed.
  To advance the understanding of this problem, we provide three results that characterize
  the limits and possibilities of batch policy optimization in the finite-armed stochastic
  bandit setting. First, we introduce a class of confidence-adjusted index algorithms
  that unifies optimistic and pessimistic principles in a common framework, which
  enables a general analysis. For this family, we show that any confidence-adjusted
  index algorithm is minimax optimal, whether it be optimistic, pessimistic or neutral.
  Our analysis reveals that instance-dependent optimality, commonly used to establish
  optimality of on-line stochastic bandit algorithms, cannot be achieved by any algorithm
  in the batch setting. In particular, for any algorithm that performs optimally in
  some environment, there exists another environment where the same algorithm suffers
  arbitrarily larger regret. Therefore, to establish a framework for distinguishing
  algorithms, we introduce a new weighted-minimax criterion that considers the inherent
  difficulty of optimal value prediction. We demonstrate how this criterion can be
  used to justify commonly used pessimistic principles for batch policy optimization.
