title: On Disentangled Representations Learned from Correlated Data
abstract: The focus of disentanglement approaches has been on identifying independent
  factors of variation in data. However, the causal variables underlying real-world
  observations are often not statistically independent. In this work, we bridge the
  gap to real-world scenarios by analyzing the behavior of the most prominent disentanglement
  approaches on correlated data in a large-scale empirical study (including 4260 models).
  We show and quantify that systematically induced correlations in the dataset are
  being learned and reflected in the latent representations, which has implications
  for downstream applications of disentanglement such as fairness. We also demonstrate
  how to resolve these latent correlations, either using weak supervision during training
  or by post-hoc correcting a pre-trained model with a small number of labels.
