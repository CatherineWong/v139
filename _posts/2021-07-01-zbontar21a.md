title: 'Barlow Twins: Self-Supervised Learning via Redundancy Reduction'
abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) is rapidly closing the gap with supervised
  methods on large computer vision benchmarks. A successful approach to SSL is to
  learn embeddings which are invariant to distortions of the input sample. However,
  a recurring issue with this approach is the existence of trivial constant solutions.
  Most current methods avoid such solutions by careful implementation details. We
  propose an objective function that naturally avoids collapse by measuring the cross-correlation
  matrix between the outputs of two identical networks fed with distorted versions
  of a sample, and making it as close to the identity matrix as possible. This causes
  the embedding vectors of distorted versions of a sample to be similar, while minimizing
  the redundancy between the components of these vectors. The method is called Barlow
  Twins, owing to neuroscientist H. Barlowâ€™s redundancy-reduction principle applied
  to a pair of identical networks. Barlow Twins does not require large batches nor
  asymmetry between the network twins such as a predictor network, gradient stopping,
  or a moving average on the weight updates. Intriguingly it benefits from very high-dimensional
  output vectors. Barlow Twins outperforms previous methods on ImageNet for semi-supervised
  classification in the low-data regime, and is on par with current state of the art
  for ImageNet classification with a linear classifier head, and for transfer tasks
  of classification and object detection.
