title: 'Predict then Interpolate: A Simple Algorithm to Learn Stable Classifiers'
abstract: We propose Predict then Interpolate (PI), a simple algorithm for learning
  correlations that are stable across environments. The algorithm follows from the
  intuition that when using a classifier trained on one environment to make predictions
  on examples from another environment, its mistakes are informative as to which correlations
  are unstable. In this work, we prove that by interpolating the distributions of
  the correct predictions and the wrong predictions, we can uncover an oracle distribution
  where the unstable correlation vanishes. Since the oracle interpolation coefficients
  are not accessible, we use group distributionally robust optimization to minimize
  the worst-case risk across all such interpolations. We evaluate our method on both
  text classification and image classification. Empirical results demonstrate that
  our algorithm is able to learn robust classifiers (outperforms IRM by 23.85% on
  synthetic environments and 12.41% on natural environments). Our code and data are
  available at https://github.com/YujiaBao/ Predict-then-Interpolate.
