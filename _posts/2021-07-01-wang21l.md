title: Deep Generative Learning via Schrödinger Bridge
abstract: We propose to learn a generative model via entropy interpolation with a
  Schr{ö}dinger Bridge. The generative learning task can be formulated as interpolating
  between a reference distribution and a target distribution based on the Kullback-Leibler
  divergence. At the population level, this entropy interpolation is characterized
  via an SDE on [0,1] with a time-varying drift term. At the sample level, we derive
  our Schr{ö}dinger Bridge algorithm by plugging the drift term estimated by a deep
  score estimator and a deep density ratio estimator into the Euler-Maruyama method.
  Under some mild smoothness assumptions of the target distribution, we prove the
  consistency of both the score estimator and the density ratio estimator, and then
  establish the consistency of the proposed Schr{ö}dinger Bridge approach. Our theoretical
  results guarantee that the distribution learned by our approach converges to the
  target distribution. Experimental results on multimodal synthetic data and benchmark
  data support our theoretical findings and indicate that the generative model via
  Schr{ö}dinger Bridge is comparable with state-of-the-art GANs, suggesting a new
  formulation of generative learning. We demonstrate its usefulness in image interpolation
  and image inpainting.
