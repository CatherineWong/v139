title: Towards Better Robust Generalization with Shift Consistency Regularization
abstract: While adversarial training becomes one of the most promising defending approaches
  against adversarial attacks for deep neural networks, the conventional wisdom through
  robust optimization may usually not guarantee good generalization for robustness.
  Concerning with robust generalization over unseen adversarial data, this paper investigates
  adversarial training from a novel perspective of shift consistency in latent space.
  We argue that the poor robust generalization of adversarial training is owing to
  the significantly dispersed latent representations generated by training and test
  adversarial data, as the adversarial perturbations push the latent features of natural
  examples in the same class towards diverse directions. This is underpinned by the
  theoretical analysis of the robust generalization gap, which is upper-bounded by
  the standard one over the natural data and a term of feature inconsistent shift
  caused by adversarial perturbation {–} a measure of latent dispersion. Towards better
  robust generalization, we propose a new regularization method {–} shift consistency
  regularization (SCR) {–} to steer the same-class latent features of both natural
  and adversarial data into a common direction during adversarial training. The effectiveness
  of SCR in adversarial training is evaluated through extensive experiments over different
  datasets, such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN, against several competitive methods.
