title: Follow-the-Regularized-Leader Routes to Chaos in Routing Games
abstract: We study the emergence of chaotic behavior of Follow-the-Regularized Leader
  (FoReL) dynamics in games. We focus on the effects of increasing the population
  size or the scale of costs in congestion games, and generalize recent results on
  unstable, chaotic behaviors in the Multiplicative Weights Update dynamics to a much
  larger class of FoReL dynamics. We establish that, even in simple linear non-atomic
  congestion games with two parallel links and \emph{any} fixed learning rate, unless
  the game is fully symmetric, increasing the population size or the scale of costs
  causes learning dynamics to becomes unstable and eventually chaotic, in the sense
  of Li-Yorke and positive topological entropy. Furthermore, we prove the existence
  of novel non-standard phenomena such as the coexistence of stable Nash equilibria
  and chaos in the same game. We also observe the simultaneous creation of a chaotic
  attractor as another chaotic attractor gets destroyed. Lastly, although FoReL dynamics
  can be strange and non-equilibrating, we prove that the time average still converges
  to an \emph{exact} equilibrium for any choice of learning rate and any scale of
  costs.
