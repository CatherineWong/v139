title: Off-Belief Learning
abstract: The standard problem setting in Dec-POMDPs is self-play, where the goal
  is to find a set of policies that play optimally together. Policies learned through
  self-play may adopt arbitrary conventions and implicitly rely on multi-step reasoning
  based on fragile assumptions about other agents’ actions and thus fail when paired
  with humans or independently trained agents at test time. To address this, we present
  off-belief learning (OBL). At each timestep OBL agents follow a policy $\pi_1$ that
  is optimized assuming past actions were taken by a given, fixed policy ($\pi_0$),
  but assuming that future actions will be taken by $\pi_1$. When $\pi_0$ is uniform
  random, OBL converges to an optimal policy that does not rely on inferences based
  on other agents’ behavior (an optimal grounded policy). OBL can be iterated in a
  hierarchy, where the optimal policy from one level becomes the input to the next,
  thereby introducing multi-level cognitive reasoning in a controlled manner. Unlike
  existing approaches, which may converge to any equilibrium policy, OBL converges
  to a unique policy, making it suitable for zero-shot coordination (ZSC). OBL can
  be scaled to high-dimensional settings with a fictitious transition mechanism and
  shows strong performance in both a toy-setting and the benchmark human-AI & ZSC
  problem Hanabi.
