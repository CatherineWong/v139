title: Logarithmic Regret for Reinforcement Learning with Linear Function Approximation
abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with linear function approximation has received
  increasing attention recently. However, existing work has focused on obtaining $\sqrt{T}$-type
  regret bound, where $T$ is the number of interactions with the MDP. In this paper,
  we show that logarithmic regret is attainable under two recently proposed linear
  MDP assumptions provided that there exists a positive sub-optimality gap for the
  optimal action-value function. More specifically, under the linear MDP assumption
  (Jin et al., 2020), the LSVI-UCB algorithm can achieve $\tilde{O}(d^{3}H^5/\text{gap}_{\text{min}}\cdot
  \log(T))$regret; and under the linear mixture MDP assumption (Ayoub et al., 2020),
  the UCRL-VTR algorithm can achieve $\tilde{O}(d^{2}H^5/\text{gap}_{\text{min}}\cdot
  \log^3(T))$ regret, where $d$ is the dimension of feature mapping, $H$ is the length
  of episode, $\text{gap}_{\text{min}}$ is the minimal sub-optimality gap, and $\tilde
  O$ hides all logarithmic terms except $\log(T)$. To the best of our knowledge, these
  are the first logarithmic regret bounds for RL with linear function approximation.
  We also establish gap-dependent lower bounds for the two linear MDP models.
