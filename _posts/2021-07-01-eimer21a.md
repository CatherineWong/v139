title: Self-Paced Context Evaluation for Contextual Reinforcement Learning
abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has made a lot of advances for solving a single
  problem in a given environment; but learning policies that generalize to unseen
  variations of a problem remains challenging. To improve sample efficiency for learning
  on such instances of a problem domain, we present Self-Paced Context Evaluation
  (SPaCE). Based on self-paced learning, SPaCE automatically generates instance curricula
  online with little computational overhead. To this end, SPaCE leverages information
  contained in state values during training to accelerate and improve training performance
  as well as generalization capabilities to new \tasks from the same problem domain.
  Nevertheless, SPaCE is independent of the problem domain at hand and can be applied
  on top of any RL agent with state-value function approximation. We demonstrate SPaCE’s
  ability to speed up learning of different value-based RL agents on two environments,
  showing better generalization capabilities and up to 10x faster learning compared
  to naive approaches such as round robin or SPDRL, as the closest state-of-the-art
  approach.
