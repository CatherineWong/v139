title: 'DouZero: Mastering DouDizhu with Self-Play Deep Reinforcement Learning'
abstract: Games are abstractions of the real world, where artificial agents learn
  to compete and cooperate with other agents. While significant achievements have
  been made in various perfect- and imperfect-information games, DouDizhu (a.k.a.
  Fighting the Landlord), a three-player card game, is still unsolved. DouDizhu is
  a very challenging domain with competition, collaboration, imperfect information,
  large state space, and particularly a massive set of possible actions where the
  legal actions vary significantly from turn to turn. Unfortunately, modern reinforcement
  learning algorithms mainly focus on simple and small action spaces, and not surprisingly,
  are shown not to make satisfactory progress in DouDizhu. In this work, we propose
  a conceptually simple yet effective DouDizhu AI system, namely DouZero, which enhances
  traditional Monte-Carlo methods with deep neural networks, action encoding, and
  parallel actors. Starting from scratch in a single server with four GPUs, DouZero
  outperformed all the existing DouDizhu AI programs in days of training and was ranked
  the first in the Botzone leaderboard among 344 AI agents. Through building DouZero,
  we show that classic Monte-Carlo methods can be made to deliver strong results in
  a hard domain with a complex action space. The code and an online demo are released
  at https://github.com/kwai/DouZero with the hope that this insight could motivate
  future work.
