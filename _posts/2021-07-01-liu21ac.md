title: Infinite-Dimensional Optimization for Zero-Sum Games via Variational Transport
abstract: 'Game optimization has been extensively studied when decision variables
  lie in a finite-dimensional space, of which solutions correspond to pure strategies
  at the Nash equilibrium (NE), and the gradient descent-ascent (GDA) method works
  widely in practice. In this paper, we consider infinite-dimensional zero-sum games
  by a min-max distributional optimization problem over a space of probability measures
  defined on a continuous variable set, which is inspired by finding a mixed NE for
  finite-dimensional zero-sum games. We then aim to answer the following question:
  \textit{Will GDA-type algorithms still be provably efficient when extended to infinite-dimensional
  zero-sum games?} To answer this question, we propose a particle-based variational
  transport algorithm based on GDA in the functional spaces. Specifically, the algorithm
  performs multi-step functional gradient descent-ascent in the Wasserstein space
  via pushing two sets of particles in the variable space. By characterizing the gradient
  estimation error from variational form maximization and the convergence behavior
  of each player with different objective landscapes, we prove rigorously that the
  generalized GDA algorithm converges to the NE or the value of the game efficiently
  for a class of games under the Polyak-≈Å{ojasiewicz} (PL) condition. To conclude,
  we provide complete statistical and convergence guarantees for solving an infinite-dimensional
  zero-sum game via a provably efficient particle-based method. Additionally, our
  work provides the first thorough statistical analysis for the particle-based algorithm
  to learn an objective functional with a variational form using universal approximators
  (\textit{i.e.}, neural networks (NNs)), which is of independent interest.'
