title: 'Muesli: Combining Improvements in Policy Optimization'
abstract: 'We propose a novel policy update that combines regularized policy optimization
  with model learning as an auxiliary loss. The update (henceforth Muesli) matches
  MuZeroâ€™s state-of-the-art performance on Atari. Notably, Muesli does so without
  using deep search: it acts directly with a policy network and has computation speed
  comparable to model-free baselines. The Atari results are complemented by extensive
  ablations, and by additional results on continuous control and 9x9 Go.'
