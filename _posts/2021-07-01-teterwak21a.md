title: Understanding Invariance via Feedforward Inversion of Discriminatively Trained
  Classifiers
abstract: 'A discriminatively trained neural net classifier can fit the training data
  perfectly if all information about its input other than class membership has been
  discarded prior to the output layer. Surprisingly, past research has discovered
  that some extraneous visual detail remains in the unnormalized logits. This finding
  is based on inversion techniques that map deep embeddings back to images. We explore
  this phenomenon further using a novel synthesis of methods, yielding a feedforward
  inversion model that produces remarkably high fidelity reconstructions, qualitatively
  superior to those of past efforts. When applied to an adversarially robust classifier
  model, the reconstructions contain sufficient local detail and global structure
  that they might be confused with the original image in a quick glance, and the object
  category can clearly be gleaned from the reconstruction. Our approach is based on
  BigGAN (Brock, 2019), with conditioning on logits instead of one-hot class labels.
  We use our reconstruction model as a tool for exploring the nature of representations,
  including: the influence of model architecture and training objectives (specifically
  robust losses), the forms of invariance that networks achieve, representational
  differences between correctly and incorrectly classified images, and the effects
  of manipulating logits and images. We believe that our method can inspire future
  investigations into the nature of information flow in a neural net and can provide
  diagnostics for improving discriminative models. We provide pre-trained models and
  visualizations at \url{https://sites.google.com/view/understanding-invariance/home}.'
