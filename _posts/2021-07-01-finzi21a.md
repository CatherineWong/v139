title: A Practical Method for Constructing Equivariant Multilayer Perceptrons for
  Arbitrary Matrix Groups
abstract: Symmetries and equivariance are fundamental to the generalization of neural
  networks on domains such as images, graphs, and point clouds. Existing work has
  primarily focused on a small number of groups, such as the translation, rotation,
  and permutation groups. In this work we provide a completely general algorithm for
  solving for the equivariant layers of matrix groups. In addition to recovering solutions
  from other works as special cases, we construct multilayer perceptrons equivariant
  to multiple groups that have never been tackled before, including $\mathrm{O}(1,3)$,
  $\mathrm{O}(5)$, $\mathrm{Sp}(n)$, and the Rubikâ€™s cube group. Our approach outperforms
  non-equivariant baselines, with applications to particle physics and modeling dynamical
  systems. We release our software library to enable researchers to construct equivariant
  layers for arbitrary
