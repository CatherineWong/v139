title: 'f-Domain Adversarial Learning: Theory and Algorithms'
abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation is used in many machine learning applications
  where, during training, a model has access to unlabeled data in the target domain,
  and a related labeled dataset. In this paper, we introduce a novel and general domain-adversarial
  framework. Specifically, we derive a novel generalization bound for domain adaptation
  that exploits a new measure of discrepancy between distributions based on a variational
  characterization of f-divergences. It recovers the theoretical results from Ben-David
  et al. (2010a) as a special case and supports divergences used in practice. Based
  on this bound, we derive a new algorithmic framework that introduces a key correction
  in the original adversarial training method of Ganin et al. (2016). We show that
  many regularizers and ad-hoc objectives introduced over the last years in this framework
  are then not required to achieve performance comparable to (if not better than)
  state-of-the-art domain-adversarial methods. Experimental analysis conducted on
  real-world natural language and computer vision datasets show that our framework
  outperforms existing baselines, and obtains the best results for f-divergences that
  were not considered previously in domain-adversarial learning.
