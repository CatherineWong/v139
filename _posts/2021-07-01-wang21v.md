title: 'SCC: an efficient deep reinforcement learning agent mastering the game of
  StarCraft II'
abstract: AlphaStar, the AI that reaches GrandMaster level in StarCraft II, is a remarkable
  milestone demonstrating what deep reinforcement learning can achieve in complex
  Real-Time Strategy (RTS) games. However, the complexities of the game, algorithms
  and systems, and especially the tremendous amount of computation needed are big
  obstacles for the community to conduct further research in this direction. We propose
  a deep reinforcement learning agent, StarCraft Commander (SCC). With order of magnitude
  less computation, it demonstrates top human performance defeating GrandMaster players
  in test matches and top professional players in a live event. Moreover, it shows
  strong robustness to various human strategies and discovers novel strategies unseen
  from human plays. In this paper, weâ€™ll share the key insights and optimizations
  on efficient imitation learning and reinforcement learning for StarCraft II full
  game.
