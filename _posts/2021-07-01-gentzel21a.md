title: How and Why to Use Experimental Data to Evaluate Methods for Observational
  Causal Inference
abstract: Methods that infer causal dependence from observational data are central
  to many areas of science, including medicine, economics, and the social sciences.
  A variety of theoretical properties of these methods have been proven, but empirical
  evaluation remains a challenge, largely due to the lack of observational data sets
  for which treatment effect is known. We describe and analyze observational sampling
  from randomized controlled trials (OSRCT), a method for evaluating causal inference
  methods using data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). This method can be
  used to create constructed observational data sets with corresponding unbiased estimates
  of treatment effect, substantially increasing the number of data sets available
  for evaluating causal inference methods. We show that, in expectation, OSRCT creates
  data sets that are equivalent to those produced by randomly sampling from empirical
  data sets in which all potential outcomes are available. We then perform a large-scale
  evaluation of seven causal inference methods over 37 data sets, drawn from RCTs,
  as well as simulators, real-world computational systems, and observational data
  sets augmented with a synthetic response variable. We find notable performance differences
  when comparing across data from different sources, demonstrating the importance
  of using data from a variety of sources when evaluating any causal inference method.
