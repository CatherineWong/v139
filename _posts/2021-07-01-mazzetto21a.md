title: Adversarial Multi Class Learning under Weak Supervision with Performance Guarantees
abstract: We develop a rigorous approach for using a set of arbitrarily correlated
  weak supervision sources in order to solve a multiclass classification task when
  only a very small set of labeled data is available. Our learning algorithm provably
  converges to a model that has minimum empirical risk with respect to an adversarial
  choice over feasible labelings for a set of unlabeled data, where the feasibility
  of a labeling is computed through constraints defined by rigorously estimated statistics
  of the weak supervision sources. We show theoretical guarantees for this approach
  that depend on the information provided by the weak supervision sources. Notably,
  this method does not require the weak supervision sources to have the same labeling
  space as the multiclass classification task. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
  our approach with experiments on various image classification tasks.
