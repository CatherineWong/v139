title: Structured Convolutional Kernel Networks for Airline Crew Scheduling
abstract: Motivated by the needs from an airline crew scheduling application, we introduce
  structured convolutional kernel networks (Struct-CKN), which combine CKNs from Mairal
  et al. (2014) in a structured prediction framework that supports constraints on
  the outputs. CKNs are a particular kind of convolutional neural networks that approximate
  a kernel feature map on training data, thus combining properties of deep learning
  with the non-parametric flexibility of kernel methods. Extending CKNs to structured
  outputs allows us to obtain useful initial solutions on a flight-connection dataset
  that can be further refined by an airline crew scheduling solver. More specifically,
  we use a flight-based network modeled as a general conditional random field capable
  of incorporating local constraints in the learning process. Our experiments demonstrate
  that this approach yields significant improvements for the large-scale crew pairing
  problem (50,000 flights per month) over standard approaches, reducing the solution
  cost by 17% (a gain of millions of dollars) and the cost of global constraints by
  97%.
