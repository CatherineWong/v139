title: A Proxy Variable View of Shared Confounding
abstract: Causal inference from observational data can be biased by unobserved confounders.
  Confounders{—}the variables that affect both the treatments and the outcome{—}induce
  spurious non-causal correlations between the two. Without additional conditions,
  unobserved confounders generally make causal quantities hard to identify. In this
  paper, we focus on the setting where there are many treatments with shared confounding,
  and we study under what conditions is causal identification possible. The key observation
  is that we can view subsets of treatments as proxies of the unobserved confounder
  and identify the intervention distributions of the rest. Moreover, while existing
  identification formulas for proxy variables involve solving integral equations,
  we show that one can circumvent the need for such solutions by directly modeling
  the data. Finally, we extend these results to an expanded class of causal graphs,
  those with other confounders and selection variables.
