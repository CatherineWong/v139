title: Grounding Language to Entities and Dynamics for Generalization in Reinforcement
  Learning
abstract: We investigate the use of natural language to drive the generalization of
  control policies and introduce the new multi-task environment Messenger with free-form
  text manuals describing the environment dynamics. Unlike previous work, Messenger
  does not assume prior knowledge connecting text and state observations {â€”} the control
  policy must simultaneously ground the game manual to entity symbols and dynamics
  in the environment. We develop a new model, EMMA (Entity Mapper with Multi-modal
  Attention) which uses an entity-conditioned attention module that allows for selective
  focus over relevant descriptions in the manual for each entity in the environment.
  EMMA is end-to-end differentiable and learns a latent grounding of entities and
  dynamics from text to observations using only environment rewards. EMMA achieves
  successful zero-shot generalization to unseen games with new dynamics, obtaining
  a 40% higher win rate compared to multiple baselines. However, win rate on the hardest
  stage of Messenger remains low (10%), demonstrating the need for additional work
  in this direction.
