title: Bayesian Structural Adaptation for Continual Learning
abstract: Continual Learning is a learning paradigm where learning systems are trained
  on a sequence of tasks. The goal here is to perform well on the current task without
  suffering from a performance drop on the previous tasks. Two notable directions
  among the recent advances in continual learning with neural networks are (1) variational
  Bayes based regularization by learning priors from previous tasks, and, (2) learning
  the structure of deep networks to adapt to new tasks. So far, these two approaches
  have been largely orthogonal. We present a novel Bayesian framework based on continually
  learning the structure of deep neural networks, to unify these distinct yet complementary
  approaches. The proposed framework learns the deep structure for each task by learning
  which weights to be used, and supports inter-task transfer through the overlapping
  of different sparse subsets of weights learned by different tasks. An appealing
  aspect of our proposed continual learning framework is that it is applicable to
  both discriminative (supervised) and generative (unsupervised) settings. Experimental
  results on supervised and unsupervised benchmarks demonstrate that our approach
  performs comparably or better than recent advances in continual learning.
