title: Online Learning for Load Balancing of Unknown Monotone Resource Allocation
  Games
abstract: Consider N players that each uses a mixture of K resources. Each of the
  players’ reward functions includes a linear pricing term for each resource that
  is controlled by the game manager. We assume that the game is strongly monotone,
  so if each player runs gradient descent, the dynamics converge to a unique Nash
  equilibrium (NE). Unfortunately, this NE can be inefficient since the total load
  on a given resource can be very high. In principle, we can control the total loads
  by tuning the coefficients of the pricing terms. However, finding pricing coefficients
  that balance the loads requires knowing the players’ reward functions and their
  action sets. Obtaining this game structure information is infeasible in a large-scale
  network and violates the users’ privacy. To overcome this, we propose a simple algorithm
  that learns to shift the NE of the game to meet the total load constraints by adjusting
  the pricing coefficients in an online manner. Our algorithm only requires the total
  load per resource as feedback and does not need to know the reward functions or
  the action sets. We prove that our algorithm guarantees convergence in L2 to a NE
  that meets target total load constraints. Simulations show the effectiveness of
  our approach when applied to smart grid demand-side management or power control
  in wireless networks.
