title: Permutation Weighting
abstract: A commonly applied approach for estimating causal effects from observational
  data is to apply weights which render treatments independent of observed pre-treatment
  covariates. Recently emphasis has been placed on deriving balancing weights which
  explicitly target this independence condition. In this work we introduce permutation
  weighting, a method for estimating balancing weights using a standard binary classifier
  (regardless of cardinality of treatment). A large class of probabilistic classifiers
  may be used in this method; the choice of loss for the classifier implies the particular
  definition of balance. We bound bias and variance in terms of the excess risk of
  the classifier, show that these disappear asymptotically, and demonstrate that our
  classification problem directly minimizes imbalance. Additionally, hyper-parameter
  tuning and model selection can be performed with standard cross-validation methods.
  Empirical evaluations indicate that permutation weighting provides favorable performance
  in comparison to existing methods.
