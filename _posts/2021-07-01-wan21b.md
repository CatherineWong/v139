title: 'Think Global and Act Local: Bayesian Optimisation over High-Dimensional Categorical
  and Mixed Search Spaces'
abstract: High-dimensional black-box optimisation remains an important yet notoriously
  challenging problem. Despite the success of Bayesian optimisation methods on continuous
  domains, domains that are categorical, or that mix continuous and categorical variables,
  remain challenging. We propose a novel solutionâ€”we combine local optimisation with
  a tailored kernel design, effectively handling high-dimensional categorical and
  mixed search spaces, whilst retaining sample efficiency. We further derive convergence
  guarantee for the proposed approach. Finally, we demonstrate empirically that our
  method outperforms the current baselines on a variety of synthetic and real-world
  tasks in terms of performance, computational costs, or both.
