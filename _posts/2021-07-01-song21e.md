title: Oblivious Sketching-based Central Path Method for Linear Programming
abstract: In this work, we propose a sketching-based central path method for solving
  linear programmings, whose running time matches the state of the art results [Cohen,
  Lee, Song STOC 19; Lee, Song, Zhang COLT 19]. Our method opens up the iterations
  of the central path method and deploys an "iterate and sketch" approach towards
  the problem by introducing a new coordinate-wise embedding technique, which may
  be of independent interest. Compare to previous methods, the work [Cohen, Lee, Song
  STOC 19] enjoys feasibility while being non-oblivious, and [Lee, Song, Zhang COLT
  19] is oblivious but infeasible, and relies on $\mathit{dense}$ sketching matrices
  such as subsampled randomized Hadamard/Fourier transform matrices. Our method enjoys
  the benefits of being both oblivious and feasible, and can use $\mathit{sparse}$
  sketching matrix [Nelson, Nguyen FOCS 13] to speed up the online matrix-vector multiplication.
  Our framework for solving LP naturally generalizes to a broader class of convex
  optimization problems including empirical risk minimization.
