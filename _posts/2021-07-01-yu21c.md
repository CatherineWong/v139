title: 'Whittle Networks: A Deep Likelihood Model for Time Series'
abstract: While probabilistic circuits have been extensively explored for tabular data,
  less attention has been paid to time series. Here, the goal is to estimate joint
  densities among the entire time series and, in turn, determining, for instance,
  conditional independence relations between them. To this end, we propose the first
  probabilistic circuits (PCs) approach for modeling the joint distribution of multivariate
  time series, called Whittle sum-product networks (WSPNs). WSPNs leverage the Whittle
  approximation, casting the likelihood in the frequency domain, and place a complex-valued
  sum-product network, the most prominent PC, over the frequencies. The conditional
  independence relations among the time series can then be determined efficiently
  in the spectral domain. Moreover, WSPNs can naturally be placed into the deep neural
  learning stack for time series, resulting in Whittle Networks, opening the likelihood
  toolbox for training deep neural models and inspecting their behaviour. Our experiments
  show that Whittle Networks can indeed capture complex dependencies between time
  series and provide a useful measure of uncertainty for neural networks.
