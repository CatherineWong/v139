title: 'To be Robust or to be Fair: Towards Fairness in Adversarial Training'
abstract: Adversarial training algorithms have been proved to be reliable to improve
  machine learning models’ robustness against adversarial examples. However, we find
  that adversarial training algorithms tend to introduce severe disparity of accuracy
  and robustness between different groups of data. For instance, PGD adversarially
  trained ResNet18 model on CIFAR-10 has 93% clean accuracy and 67% PGD l_infty-8
  adversarial accuracy on the class ”automobile” but only 65% and 17% on class ”cat”.
  This phenomenon happens in balanced datasets and does not exist in naturally trained
  models when only using clean samples. In this work, we empirically and theoretically
  show that this phenomenon can generally happen under adversarial training algorithms
  which minimize DNN models’ robust errors. Motivated by these findings, we propose
  a Fair-Robust-Learning (FRL) framework to mitigate this unfairness problem when
  doing adversarial defenses and experimental results validate the effectiveness of
  FRL.
