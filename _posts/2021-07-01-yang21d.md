title: 'LARNet: Lie Algebra Residual Network for Face Recognition'
abstract: Face recognition is an important yet challenging problem in computer vision.
  A major challenge in practical face recognition applications lies in significant
  variations between profile and frontal faces. Traditional techniques address this
  challenge either by synthesizing frontal faces or by pose invariant learning. In
  this paper, we propose a novel method with Lie algebra theory to explore how face
  rotation in the 3D space affects the deep feature generation process of convolutional
  neural networks (CNNs). We prove that face rotation in the image space is equivalent
  to an additive residual component in the feature space of CNNs, which is determined
  solely by the rotation. Based on this theoretical finding, we further design a Lie
  Algebraic Residual Network (LARNet) for tackling pose robust face recognition. Our
  LARNet consists of a residual subnet for decoding rotation information from input
  face images, and a gating subnet to learn rotation magnitude for controlling the
  strength of the residual component contributing to the feature learning process.
  Comprehensive experimental evaluations on both frontal-profile face datasets and
  general face recognition datasets convincingly demonstrate that our method consistently
  outperforms the state-of-the-art ones.
