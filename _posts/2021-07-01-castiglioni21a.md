title: Multi-Receiver Online Bayesian Persuasion
abstract: 'Bayesian persuasion studies how an informed sender should partially disclose
  information to influence the behavior of a self-interested receiver. Classical models
  make the stringent assumption that the sender knows the receiver’s utility. This
  can be relaxed by considering an online learning framework in which the sender repeatedly
  faces a receiver of an unknown, adversarially selected type. We study, for the first
  time, an online Bayesian persuasion setting with multiple receivers. We focus on
  the case with no externalities and binary actions, as customary in offline models.
  Our goal is to design no-regret algorithms for the sender with polynomial per-iteration
  running time. First, we prove a negative result: for any 0 < $\alpha$ $\leq$ 1,
  there is no polynomial-time no-$\alpha$-regret algorithm when the sender’s utility
  function is supermodular or anonymous. Then, we focus on the setting of submodular
  sender’s utility functions and we show that, in this case, it is possible to design
  a polynomial-time no-(1-1/e)-regret algorithm. To do so, we introduce a general
  online gradient descent framework to handle online learning problems with a finite
  number of possible loss functions. This requires the existence of an approximate
  projection oracle. We show that, in our setting, there exists one such projection
  oracle which can be implemented in polynomial time.'
