title: 'Regularizing towards Causal Invariance: Linear Models with Proxies'
abstract: We propose a method for learning linear models whose predictive performance
  is robust to causal interventions on unobserved variables, when noisy proxies of
  those variables are available. Our approach takes the form of a regularization term
  that trades off between in-distribution performance and robustness to interventions.
  Under the assumption of a linear structural causal model, we show that a single
  proxy can be used to create estimators that are prediction optimal under interventions
  of bounded strength. This strength depends on the magnitude of the measurement noise
  in the proxy, which is, in general, not identifiable. In the case of two proxy variables,
  we propose a modified estimator that is prediction optimal under interventions up
  to a known strength. We further show how to extend these estimators to scenarios
  where additional information about the "test time" intervention is available during
  training. We evaluate our theoretical findings in synthetic experiments and using
  real data of hourly pollution levels across several cities in China.
