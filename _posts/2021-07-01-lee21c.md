title: On-the-fly Rectification for Robust Large-Vocabulary Topic Inference
abstract: Across many data domains, co-occurrence statistics about the joint appearance
  of objects are powerfully informative. By transforming unsupervised learning problems
  into decompositions of co-occurrence statistics, spectral algorithms provide transparent
  and efficient algorithms for posterior inference such as latent topic analysis and
  community detection. As object vocabularies grow, however, it becomes rapidly more
  expensive to store and run inference algorithms on co-occurrence statistics. Rectifying
  co-occurrence, the key process to uphold model assumptions, becomes increasingly
  more vital in the presence of rare terms, but current techniques cannot scale to
  large vocabularies. We propose novel methods that simultaneously compress and rectify
  co-occurrence statistics, scaling gracefully with the size of vocabulary and the
  dimension of latent space. We also present new algorithms learning latent variables
  from the compressed statistics, and verify that our methods perform comparably to
  previous approaches on both textual and non-textual data.
