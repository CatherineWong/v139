title: Online Selection Problems against Constrained Adversary
abstract: Inspired by a recent line of work in online algorithms with predictions,
  we study the constrained adversary model that utilizes predictions from a different
  perspective. Prior works mostly focused on designing simultaneously robust and consistent
  algorithms, without making assumptions on the quality of the predictions. In contrary,
  our model assumes the adversarial instance is consistent with the predictions and
  aim to design algorithms that have best worst-case performance against all such
  instances. We revisit classical online selection problems under the constrained
  adversary model. For the single item selection problem, we design an optimal algorithm
  in the adversarial arrival model and an improved algorithm in the random arrival
  model (a.k.a., the secretary problem). For the online edge-weighted bipartite matching
  problem, we extend the classical Water-filling and Ranking algorithms and achieve
  improved competitive ratios.
