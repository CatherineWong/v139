title: Learning from History for Byzantine Robust Optimization
abstract: 'Byzantine robustness has received significant attention recently given
  its importance for distributed and federated learning. In spite of this, we identify
  severe flaws in existing algorithms even when the data across the participants is
  identically distributed. First, we show realistic examples where current state of
  the art robust aggregation rules fail to converge even in the absence of any Byzantine
  attackers. Secondly, we prove that even if the aggregation rules may succeed in
  limiting the influence of the attackers in a single round, the attackers can couple
  their attacks across time eventually leading to divergence. To address these issues,
  we present two surprisingly simple strategies: a new robust iterative clipping procedure,
  and incorporating worker momentum to overcome time-coupled attacks. This is the
  first provably robust method for the standard stochastic optimization setting.'
