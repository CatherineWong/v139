title: 'Run-Sort-ReRun: Escaping Batch Size Limitations in Sliced Wasserstein Generative
  Models'
abstract: When training an implicit generative model, ideally one would like the generator
  to reproduce all the different modes and subtleties of the target distribution.
  Naturally, when comparing two empirical distributions, the larger the sample population,
  the more these statistical nuances can be captured. However, existing objective
  functions are computationally constrained in the amount of samples they can consider
  by the memory required to process a batch of samples. In this paper, we build upon
  recent progress in sliced Wasserstein distances, a family of differentiable metrics
  for distribution discrepancy based on the Optimal Transport paradigm. We introduce
  a procedure to train these distances with virtually any batch size, allowing the
  discrepancy measure to capture richer statistics and better approximating the distance
  between the underlying continuous distributions. As an example, we demonstrate the
  matching of the distribution of Inception features with batches of tens of thousands
  of samples, achieving FID scores that outperform state-of-the-art implicit generative
  models.
