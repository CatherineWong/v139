title: Meta-learning Hyperparameter Performance Prediction with Neural Processes
abstract: The surrogate that predicts the performance of hyperparameters has been
  a key component for sequential model-based hyperparameter optimization. In practical
  applications, a trial of a hyper-parameter configuration may be so costly that a
  surrogate is expected to return an optimal configuration with as few trials as possible.
  Observing that human experts draw on their expertise in a machine learning model
  by trying configurations that once performed well on other datasets, we are inspired
  to build a trial-efficient surrogate by transferring the meta-knowledge learned
  from historical trials on other datasets. We propose an end-to-end surrogate named
  as Transfer NeuralProcesses (TNP) that learns a comprehensive set of meta-knowledge,
  including the parameters of historical surrogates, historical trials, and initial
  configurations for other datasets. Experiments on extensive OpenML datasets and
  three computer vision datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves
  state-of-the-art performance in at least one order of magnitude less trials.
