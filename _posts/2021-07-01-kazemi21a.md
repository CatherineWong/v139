title: Regularized Submodular Maximization at Scale
abstract: In this paper, we propose scalable methods for maximizing a regularized
  submodular function $f \triangleq g-\ell$ expressed as the difference between a
  monotone submodular function $g$ and a modular function $\ell$. Submodularity is
  inherently related to the notions of diversity, coverage, and representativeness.
  In particular, finding the mode (i.e., the most likely configuration) of many popular
  probabilistic models of diversity, such as determinantal point processes and strongly
  log-concave distributions, involves maximization of (regularized) submodular functions.
  Since a regularized function $f$ can potentially take on negative values, the classic
  theory of submodular maximization, which heavily relies on the non-negativity assumption
  of submodular functions, is not applicable. To circumvent this challenge, we develop
  the first one-pass streaming algorithm for maximizing a regularized submodular function
  subject to a $k$-cardinality constraint. Furthermore, we develop the first distributed
  algorithm that returns a solution $S$ in $O(1/ \epsilon)$ rounds of MapReduce computation.
  We highlight that our result, even for the unregularized case where the modular
  term $\ell$ is zero, improves the memory and communication complexity of the state-of-the-art
  by a factor of $O(1/ \epsilon)$ while arguably provides a simpler distributed algorithm
  and a unifying analysis. We empirically study the performance of our scalable methods
  on a set of real-life applications, including finding the mode of negatively correlated
  distributions, vertex cover of social networks, and several data summarization tasks.
