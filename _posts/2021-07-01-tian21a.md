title: Understanding self-supervised learning dynamics without contrastive pairs
abstract: 'While contrastive approaches of self-supervised learning (SSL) learn representations
  by minimizing the distance between two augmented views of the same data point (positive
  pairs) and maximizing views from different data points (negative pairs), recent
  \emph{non-contrastive} SSL (e.g., BYOL and SimSiam) show remarkable performance
  {\it without} negative pairs, with an extra learnable predictor and a stop-gradient
  operation. A fundamental question rises: why they do not collapse into trivial representation?
  In this paper, we answer this question via a simple theoretical study and propose
  a novel approach, \ourmethod{}, that \emph{directly} sets the linear predictor based
  on the statistics of its inputs, rather than trained with gradient update. On ImageNet,
  it performs comparably with more complex two-layer non-linear predictors that employ
  BatchNorm and outperforms linear predictor by $2.5%$ in 300-epoch training (and
  $5%$ in 60-epoch). \ourmethod{} is motivated by our theoretical study of the nonlinear
  learning dynamics of non-contrastive SSL in simple linear networks. Our study yields
  conceptual insights into how non-contrastive SSL methods learn, how they avoid representational
  collapse, and how multiple factors, like predictor networks, stop-gradients, exponential
  moving averages, and weight decay all come into play. Our simple theory recapitulates
  the results of real-world ablation studies in both STL-10 and ImageNet. Code is
