title: Implicit Regularization in Tensor Factorization
abstract: Recent efforts to unravel the mystery of implicit regularization in deep
  learning have led to a theoretical focus on matrix factorization — matrix completion
  via linear neural network. As a step further towards practical deep learning, we
  provide the first theoretical analysis of implicit regularization in tensor factorization
  — tensor completion via certain type of non-linear neural network. We circumvent
  the notorious difficulty of tensor problems by adopting a dynamical systems perspective,
  and characterizing the evolution induced by gradient descent. The characterization
  suggests a form of greedy low tensor rank search, which we rigorously prove under
  certain conditions, and empirically demonstrate under others. Motivated by tensor
  rank capturing the implicit regularization of a non-linear neural network, we empirically
  explore it as a measure of complexity, and find that it captures the essence of
  datasets on which neural networks generalize. This leads us to believe that tensor
  rank may pave way to explaining both implicit regularization in deep learning, and
  the properties of real-world data translating this implicit regularization to generalization.
