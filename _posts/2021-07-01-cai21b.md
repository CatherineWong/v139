title: A Theory of Label Propagation for Subpopulation Shift
abstract: One of the central problems in machine learning is domain adaptation. Different
  from past theoretical works, we consider a new model of subpopulation shift in the
  input or representation space. In this work, we propose a provably effective framework
  based on label propagation by using an input consistency loss. In our analysis we
  used a simple but realistic “expansion” assumption, which has been proposed in \citet{wei2021theoretical}.
  It turns out that based on a teacher classifier on the source domain, the learned
  classifier can not only propagate to the target domain but also improve upon the
  teacher. By leveraging existing generalization bounds, we also obtain end-to-end
  finite-sample guarantees on deep neural networks. In addition, we extend our theoretical
  framework to a more general setting of source-to-target transfer based on an additional
  unlabeled dataset, which can be easily applied to various learning scenarios. Inspired
  by our theory, we adapt consistency-based semi-supervised learning methods to domain
  adaptation settings and gain significant improvements.
