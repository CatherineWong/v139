title: Combining Pessimism with Optimism for Robust and Efficient Model-Based Deep
  Reinforcement Learning
abstract: In real-world tasks, reinforcement learning (RL) agents frequently encounter
  situations that are not present during training time. To ensure reliable performance,
  the RL agents need to exhibit robustness to such worst-case situations. The robust-RL
  framework addresses this challenge via a minimax optimization between an agent and
  an adversary. Previous robust RL algorithms are either sample inefficient, lack
  robustness guarantees, or do not scale to large problems. We propose the Robust
  Hallucinated Upper-Confidence RL (RH-UCRL) algorithm to provably solve this problem
  while attaining near-optimal sample complexity guarantees. RH-UCRL is a model-based
  reinforcement learning (MBRL) algorithm that effectively distinguishes between epistemic
  and aleatoric uncertainty and efficiently explores both the agent and the adversary
  decision spaces during policy learning. We scale RH-UCRL to complex tasks via neural
  networks ensemble models as well as neural network policies. Experimentally we demonstrate
  that RH-UCRL outperforms other robust deep RL algorithms in a variety of adversarial
  environments.
