title: A Representation Learning Perspective on the Importance of Train-Validation
  Splitting in Meta-Learning
abstract: 'An effective approach in meta-learning is to utilize multiple “train tasks”
  to learn a good initialization for model parameters that can help solve unseen “test
  tasks” with very few samples by fine-tuning from this initialization. Although successful
  in practice, theoretical understanding of such methods is limited. This work studies
  an important aspect of these methods: splitting the data from each task into train
  (support) and validation (query) sets during meta-training. Inspired by recent work
  (Raghu et al., 2020), we view such meta-learning methods through the lens of representation
  learning and argue that the train-validation split encourages the learned representation
  to be {\em low-rank} without compromising on expressivity, as opposed to the non-splitting
  variant that encourages high-rank representations. Since sample efficiency benefits
  from low-rankness, the splitting strategy will require very few samples to solve
  unseen test tasks. We present theoretical results that formalize this idea for linear
  representation learning on a subspace meta-learning instance, and experimentally
  verify this practical benefit of splitting in simulations and on standard meta-learning
  benchmarks.'
