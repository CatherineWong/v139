title: Monte Carlo Variational Auto-Encoders
abstract: 'Variational auto-encoders (VAE) are popular deep latent variable models
  which are trained by maximizing an Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO). To obtain tighter
  ELBO and hence better variational approximations, it has been proposed to use importance
  sampling to get a lower variance estimate of the evidence. However, importance sampling
  is known to perform poorly in high dimensions. While it has been suggested many
  times in the literature to use more sophisticated algorithms such as Annealed Importance
  Sampling (AIS) and its Sequential Importance Sampling (SIS) extensions, the potential
  benefits brought by these advanced techniques have never been realized for VAE:
  the AIS estimate cannot be easily differentiated, while SIS requires the specification
  of carefully chosen backward Markov kernels. In this paper, we address both issues
  and demonstrate the performance of the resulting Monte Carlo VAEs on a variety of
  applications.'
