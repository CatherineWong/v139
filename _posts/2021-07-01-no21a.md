title: WGAN with an Infinitely Wide Generator Has No Spurious Stationary Points
abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GAN) are a widely used class of deep generative
  models, but their minimax training dynamics are not understood very well. In this
  work, we show that GANs with a 2-layer infinite-width generator and a 2-layer finite-width
  discriminator trained with stochastic gradient ascent-descent have no spurious stationary
  points. We then show that when the width of the generator is finite but wide, there
  are no spurious stationary points within a ball whose radius becomes arbitrarily
  large (to cover the entire parameter space) as the width goes to infinity.
