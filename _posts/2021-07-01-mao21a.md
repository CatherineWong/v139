title: Consistent Nonparametric Methods for Network Assisted Covariate Estimation
abstract: 'Networks with node covariates are commonplace: for example, people in a
  social network have interests, or product preferences, etc. If we know the covariates
  for some nodes, can we infer them for the remaining nodes? In this paper we propose
  a new similarity measure between two nodes based on the patterns of their 2-hop
  neighborhoods. We show that a simple algorithm (CN-VEC) like nearest neighbor regression
  with this metric is consistent for a wide range of models when the degree grows
  faster than $n^{1/3}$ up-to logarithmic factors, where $n$ is the number of nodes.
  For "low-rank" latent variable models, the natural contender will be to estimate
  the latent variables using SVD and use them for non-parametric regression. While
  we show consistency of this method under less stringent sparsity conditions, our
  experimental results suggest that the simple local CN-VEC method either outperforms
  the global SVD-RBF method, or has comparable performance for low rank models. We
  also present simulated and real data experiments to show the effectiveness of our
  algorithms compared to the state of the art.'
