title: Post-selection inference with HSIC-Lasso
abstract: Detecting influential features in non-linear and/or high-dimensional data
  is a challenging and increasingly important task in machine learning. Variable selection
  methods have thus been gaining much attention as well as post-selection inference.
  Indeed, the selected features can be significantly flawed when the selection procedure
  is not accounted for. We propose a selective inference procedure using the so-called
  model-free "HSIC-Lasso" based on the framework of truncated Gaussians combined with
  the polyhedral lemma. We then develop an algorithm, which allows for low computational
  costs and provides a selection of the regularisation parameter. The performance
  of our method is illustrated by both artificial and real-world data based experiments,
  which emphasise a tight control of the type-I error, even for small sample sizes.
