title: 'Z-GCNETs: Time Zigzags at Graph Convolutional Networks for Time Series Forecasting'
abstract: There recently has been a surge of interest in developing a new class of
  deep learning (DL) architectures that integrate an explicit time dimension as a
  fundamental building block of learning and representation mechanisms. In turn, many
  recent results show that topological descriptors of the observed data, encoding
  information on the shape of the dataset in a topological space at different scales,
  that is, persistent homology of the data, may contain important complementary information,
  improving both performance and robustness of DL. As convergence of these two emerging
  ideas, we propose to enhance DL architectures with the most salient time-conditioned
  topological information of the data and introduce the concept of zigzag persistence
  into time-aware graph convolutional networks (GCNs). Zigzag persistence provides
  a systematic and mathematically rigorous framework to track the most important topological
  features of the observed data that tend to manifest themselves over time. To integrate
  the extracted time-conditioned topological descriptors into DL, we develop a new
  topological summary, zigzag persistence image, and derive its theoretical stability
  guarantees. We validate the new GCNs with a time-aware zigzag topological layer
  (Z-GCNETs), in application to traffic forecasting and Ethereum blockchain price
  prediction. Our results indicate that Z-GCNET outperforms 13 state-of-the-art methods
  on 4 time series datasets.
