title: Continuous Coordination As a Realistic Scenario for Lifelong Learning
abstract: Current deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are still highly task-specific
  and lack the ability to generalize to new environments. Lifelong learning (LLL),
  however, aims at solving multiple tasks sequentially by efficiently transferring
  and using knowledge between tasks. Despite a surge of interest in lifelong RL in
  recent years, the lack of a realistic testbed makes robust evaluation of LLL algorithms
  difficult. Multi-agent RL (MARL), on the other hand, can be seen as a natural scenario
  for lifelong RL due to its inherent non-stationarity, since the agents’ policies
  change over time. In this work, we introduce a multi-agent lifelong learning testbed
  that supports both zero-shot and few-shot settings. Our setup is based on Hanabi
  {—} a partially-observable, fully cooperative multi-agent game that has been shown
  to be challenging for zero-shot coordination. Its large strategy space makes it
  a desirable environment for lifelong RL tasks. We evaluate several recent MARL methods,
  and benchmark state-of-the-art LLL algorithms in limited memory and computation
  regimes to shed light on their strengths and weaknesses. This continual learning
  paradigm also provides us with a pragmatic way of going beyond centralized training
  which is the most commonly used training protocol in MARL. We empirically show that
  the agents trained in our setup are able to coordinate well with unseen agents,
  without any additional assumptions made by previous works. The code and all pre-trained
  models are available at https://github.com/chandar-lab/Lifelong-Hanabi.
