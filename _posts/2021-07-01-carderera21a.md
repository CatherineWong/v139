title: Parameter-free Locally Accelerated Conditional Gradients
abstract: Projection-free conditional gradient (CG) methods are the algorithms of
  choice for constrained optimization setups in which projections are often computationally
  prohibitive but linear optimization over the constraint set remains computationally
  feasible. Unlike in projection-based methods, globally accelerated convergence rates
  are in general unattainable for CG. However, a very recent work on Locally accelerated
  CG (LaCG) has demonstrated that local acceleration for CG is possible for many settings
  of interest. The main downside of LaCG is that it requires knowledge of the smoothness
  and strong convexity parameters of the objective function. We remove this limitation
  by introducing a novel, Parameter-Free Locally accelerated CG (PF-LaCG) algorithm,
  for which we provide rigorous convergence guarantees. Our theoretical results are
  complemented by numerical experiments, which demonstrate local acceleration and
  showcase the practical improvements of PF-LaCG over non-accelerated algorithms,
  both in terms of iteration count and wall-clock time.
