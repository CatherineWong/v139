title: Model Performance Scaling with Multiple Data Sources
abstract: Real-world machine learning systems are often trained using a mix of data
  sources with varying cost and quality. Understanding how the size and composition
  of a training dataset affect model performance is critical for advancing our understanding
  of generalization, as well as designing more effective data collection policies.
  We show that there is a simple scaling law that predicts the loss incurred by a
  model even under varying dataset composition. Our work expands recent observations
  of scaling laws for log-linear generalization error in the i.i.d setting and uses
  this to cast model performance prediction as a learning problem. Using the theory
  of optimal experimental design, we derive a simple rational function approximation
  to generalization error that can be fitted using a few model training runs. Our
  approach can achieve highly accurate ($r^2\approx .9$) predictions of model performance
  under substantial extrapolation in two different standard supervised learning tasks
  and is accurate ($r^2 \approx .83$) on more challenging machine translation and
  question answering tasks where many baselines achieve worse-than-random performance.
