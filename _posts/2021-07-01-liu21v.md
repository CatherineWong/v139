title: Learning Deep Neural Networks under Agnostic Corrupted Supervision
abstract: Training deep neural network models in the presence of corrupted supervision
  is challenging as the corrupted data points may significantly impact generalization
  performance. To alleviate this problem, we present an efficient robust algorithm
  that achieves strong guarantees without any assumption on the type of corruption
  and provides a unified framework for both classification and regression problems.
  Unlike many existing approaches that quantify the quality of the data points (e.g.,
  based on their individual loss values), and filter them accordingly, the proposed
  algorithm focuses on controlling the collective impact of data points on the average
  gradient. Even when a corrupted data point failed to be excluded by our algorithm,
  the data point will have a very limited impact on the overall loss, as compared
  with state-of-the-art filtering methods based on loss values. Extensive experiments
  on multiple benchmark datasets have demonstrated the robustness of our algorithm
  under different types of corruption. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/illidanlab/PRL}.
