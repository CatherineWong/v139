title: 'World Model as a Graph: Learning Latent Landmarks for Planning'
abstract: Planning, the ability to analyze the structure of a problem in the large
  and decompose it into interrelated subproblems, is a hallmark of human intelligence.
  While deep reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great promise for solving relatively
  straightforward control tasks, it remains an open problem how to best incorporate
  planning into existing deep RL paradigms to handle increasingly complex environments.
  One prominent framework, Model-Based RL, learns a world model and plans using step-by-step
  virtual rollouts. This type of world model quickly diverges from reality when the
  planning horizon increases, thus struggling at long-horizon planning. How can we
  learn world models that endow agents with the ability to do temporally extended
  reasoning? In this work, we propose to learn graph-structured world models composed
  of sparse, multi-step transitions. We devise a novel algorithm to learn latent landmarks
  that are scattered (in terms of reachability) across the goal space as the nodes
  on the graph. In this same graph, the edges are the reachability estimates distilled
  from Q-functions. On a variety of high-dimensional continuous control tasks ranging
  from robotic manipulation to navigation, we demonstrate that our method, named L3P,
  significantly outperforms prior work, and is oftentimes the only method capable
  of leveraging both the robustness of model-free RL and generalization of graph-search
  algorithms. We believe our work is an important step towards scalable planning in
  reinforcement learning.
