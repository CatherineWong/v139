title: 'DANCE: Enhancing saliency maps using decoys'
abstract: Saliency methods can make deep neural network predictions more interpretable
  by identifying a set of critical features in an input sample, such as pixels that
  contribute most strongly to a prediction made by an image classifier. Unfortunately,
  recent evidence suggests that many saliency methods poorly perform, especially in
  situations where gradients are saturated, inputs contain adversarial perturbations,
  or predictions rely upon inter-feature dependence. To address these issues, we propose
  a framework, DANCE, which improves the robustness of saliency methods by following
  a two-step procedure. First, we introduce a perturbation mechanism that subtly varies
  the input sample without changing its intermediate representations. Using this approach,
  we can gather a corpus of perturbed ("decoy") data samples while ensuring that the
  perturbed and original input samples follow similar distributions. Second, we compute
  saliency maps for the decoy samples and propose a new method to aggregate saliency
  maps. With this design, we offset influence of gradient saturation. From a theoretical
  perspective, we show that the aggregated saliency map not only captures inter-feature
  dependence but, more importantly, is robust against previously described adversarial
  perturbation methods. Our empirical results suggest that, both qualitatively and
  quantitatively, DANCE outperforms existing methods in a variety of application domains.
