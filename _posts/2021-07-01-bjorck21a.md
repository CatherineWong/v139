title: 'Low-Precision Reinforcement Learning: Running Soft Actor-Critic in Half Precision'
abstract: Low-precision training has become a popular approach to reduce compute requirements,
  memory footprint, and energy consumption in supervised learning. In contrast, this
  promising approach has not yet enjoyed similarly widespread adoption within the
  reinforcement learning (RL) community, partly because RL agents can be notoriously
  hard to train even in full precision. In this paper we consider continuous control
  with the state-of-the-art SAC agent and demonstrate that a naïve adaptation of low-precision
  methods from supervised learning fails. We propose a set of six modifications, all
  straightforward to implement, that leaves the underlying agent and its hyperparameters
  unchanged but improves the numerical stability dramatically. The resulting modified
  SAC agent has lower memory and compute requirements while matching full-precision
  rewards, demonstrating that low-precision training can substantially accelerate
  state-of-the-art RL without parameter tuning.
