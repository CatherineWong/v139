title: Accuracy, Interpretability, and Differential Privacy via Explainable Boosting
abstract: 'We show that adding differential privacy to Explainable Boosting Machines
  (EBMs), a recent method for training interpretable ML models, yields state-of-the-art
  accuracy while protecting privacy. Our experiments on multiple classification and
  regression datasets show that DP-EBM models suffer surprisingly little accuracy
  loss even with strong differential privacy guarantees. In addition to high accuracy,
  two other benefits of applying DP to EBMs are: a) trained models provide exact global
  and local interpretability, which is often important in settings where differential
  privacy is needed; and b) the models can be edited after training without loss of
  privacy to correct errors which DP noise may have introduced.'
