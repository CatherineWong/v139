title: Debiasing Model Updates for Improving Personalized Federated Training
abstract: We propose a novel method for federated learning that is customized specifically
  to the objective of a given edge device. In our proposed method, a server trains
  a global meta-model by collaborating with devices without actually sharing data.
  The trained global meta-model is then personalized locally by each device to meet
  its specific objective. Different from the conventional federated learning setting,
  training customized models for each device is hindered by both the inherent data
  biases of the various devices, as well as the requirements imposed by the federated
  architecture. We propose gradient correction methods leveraging prior works, and
  explicitly de-bias the meta-model in the distributed heterogeneous data setting
  to learn personalized device models. We present convergence guarantees of our method
  for strongly convex, convex and nonconvex meta objectives. We empirically evaluate
  the performance of our method on benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant
  communication savings.
