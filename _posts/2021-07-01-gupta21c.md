title: Correcting Exposure Bias for Link Recommendation
abstract: Link prediction methods are frequently applied in recommender systems, e.g.,
  to suggest citations for academic papers or friends in social networks. However,
  exposure bias can arise when users are systematically underexposed to certain relevant
  items. For example, in citation networks, authors might be more likely to encounter
  papers from their own field and thus cite them preferentially. This bias can propagate
  through naively trained link predictors, leading to both biased evaluation and high
  generalization error (as assessed by true relevance). Moreover, this bias can be
  exacerbated by feedback loops. We propose estimators that leverage known exposure
  probabilities to mitigate this bias and consequent feedback loops. Next, we provide
  a loss function for learning the exposure probabilities from data. Finally, experiments
  on semi-synthetic data based on real-world citation networks, show that our methods
  reliably identify (truly) relevant citations. Additionally, our methods lead to
  greater diversity in the recommended papersâ€™ fields of study. The code is available
  at github.com/shantanu95/exposure-bias-link-rec.
