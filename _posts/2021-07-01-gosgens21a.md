title: 'Systematic Analysis of Cluster Similarity Indices: How to Validate Validation
  Measures'
abstract: 'Many cluster similarity indices are used to evaluate clustering algorithms,
  and choosing the best one for a particular task remains an open problem. We demonstrate
  that this problem is crucial: there are many disagreements among the indices, these
  disagreements do affect which algorithms are preferred in applications, and this
  can lead to degraded performance in real-world systems. We propose a theoretical
  framework to tackle this problem: we develop a list of desirable properties and
  conduct an extensive theoretical analysis to verify which indices satisfy them.
  This allows for making an informed choice: given a particular application, one can
  first select properties that are desirable for the task and then identify indices
  satisfying these. Our work unifies and considerably extends existing attempts at
  analyzing cluster similarity indices: we introduce new properties, formalize existing
  ones, and mathematically prove or disprove each property for an extensive list of
  validation indices. This broader and more rigorous approach leads to recommendations
  that considerably differ from how validation indices are currently being chosen
  by practitioners. Some of the most popular indices are even shown to be dominated
  by previously overlooked ones.'
