title: Learning Diverse-Structured Networks for Adversarial Robustness
abstract: 'In adversarial training (AT), the main focus has been the objective and
  optimizer while the model has been less studied, so that the models being used are
  still those classic ones in standard training (ST). Classic network architectures
  (NAs) are generally worse than searched NA in ST, which should be the same in AT.
  In this paper, we argue that NA and AT cannot be handled independently, since given
  a dataset, the optimal NA in ST would be no longer optimal in AT. That being said,
  AT is time-consuming itself; if we directly search NAs in AT over large search spaces,
  the computation will be practically infeasible. Thus, we propose diverse-structured
  network (DS-Net), to significantly reduce the size of the search space: instead
  of low-level operations, we only consider predefined atomic blocks, where an atomic
  block is a time-tested building block like the residual block. There are only a
  few atomic blocks and thus we can weight all atomic blocks rather than find the
  best one in a searched block of DS-Net, which is an essential tradeoff between exploring
  diverse structures and exploiting the best structures. Empirical results demonstrate
  the advantages of DS-Net, i.e., weighting the atomic blocks.'
