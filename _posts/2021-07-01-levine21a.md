title: Improved, Deterministic Smoothing for L_1 Certified Robustness
abstract: 'Randomized smoothing is a general technique for computing sample-dependent
  robustness guarantees against adversarial attacks for deep classifiers. Prior works
  on randomized smoothing against L_1 adversarial attacks use additive smoothing noise
  and provide probabilistic robustness guarantees. In this work, we propose a non-additive
  and deterministic smoothing method, Deterministic Smoothing with Splitting Noise
  (DSSN). To develop DSSN, we first develop SSN, a randomized method which involves
  generating each noisy smoothing sample by first randomly splitting the input space
  and then returning a representation of the center of the subdivision occupied by
  the input sample. In contrast to uniform additive smoothing, the SSN certification
  does not require the random noise components used to be independent. Thus, smoothing
  can be done effectively in just one dimension and can therefore be efficiently derandomized
  for quantized data (e.g., images). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
  work to provide deterministic "randomized smoothing" for a norm-based adversarial
  threat model while allowing for an arbitrary classifier (i.e., a deep model) to
  be used as a base classifier and without requiring an exponential number of smoothing
  samples. On CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, we provide substantially larger L_1
  robustness certificates compared to prior works, establishing a new state-of-the-art.
  The determinism of our method also leads to significantly faster certificate computation.
