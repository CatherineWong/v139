title: Optimal Non-Convex Exact Recovery in Stochastic Block Model via Projected Power
  Method
abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of exact community recovery in the symmetric
  stochastic block model, where a graph of $n$ vertices is randomly generated by partitioning
  the vertices into $K \ge 2$ equal-sized communities and then connecting each pair
  of vertices with probability that depends on their community memberships. Although
  the maximum-likelihood formulation of this problem is discrete and non-convex, we
  propose to tackle it directly using projected power iterations with an initialization
  that satisfies a partial recovery condition. Such an initialization can be obtained
  by a host of existing methods. We show that in the logarithmic degree regime of
  the considered problem, the proposed method can exactly recover the underlying communities
  at the information-theoretic limit. Moreover, with a qualified initialization, it
  runs in $\mO(n\log^2n/\log\log n)$ time, which is competitive with existing state-of-the-art
  methods. We also present numerical results of the proposed method to support and
  complement our theoretical development.
