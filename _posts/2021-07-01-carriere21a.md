title: Optimizing persistent homology based functions
abstract: Solving optimization tasks based on functions and losses with a topological
  flavor is a very active and growing field of research in data science and Topological
  Data Analysis, with applications in non-convex optimization, statistics and machine
  learning. However, the approaches proposed in the literature are usually anchored
  to a specific application and/or topological construction, and do not come with
  theoretical guarantees. To address this issue, we study the differentiability of
  a general map associated with the most common topological construction, that is,
  the persistence map. Building on real analytic geometry arguments, we propose a
  general framework that allows us to define and compute gradients for persistence-based
  functions in a very simple way. We also provide a simple, explicit and sufficient
  condition for convergence of stochastic subgradient methods for such functions.
  This result encompasses all the constructions and applications of topological optimization
  in the literature. Finally, we provide associated code, that is easy to handle and
  to mix with other non-topological methods and constraints, as well as some experiments
  showcasing the versatility of our approach.
