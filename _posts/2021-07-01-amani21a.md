title: Safe Reinforcement Learning with Linear Function Approximation
abstract: Safety in reinforcement learning has become increasingly important in recent
  years. Yet, existing solutions either fail to strictly avoid choosing unsafe actions,
  which may lead to catastrophic results in safety-critical systems, or fail to provide
  regret guarantees for settings where safety constraints need to be learned. In this
  paper, we address both problems by first modeling safety as an unknown linear cost
  function of states and actions, which must always fall below a certain threshold.
  We then present algorithms, termed SLUCB-QVI and RSLUCB-QVI, for episodic Markov
  decision processes (MDPs) with linear function approximation. We show that SLUCB-QVI
  and RSLUCB-QVI, while with \emph{no safety violation}, achieve a $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\kappa\sqrt{d^3H^3T}\right)$
  regret, nearly matching that of state-of-the-art unsafe algorithms, where $H$ is
  the duration of each episode, $d$ is the dimension of the feature mapping, $\kappa$
  is a constant characterizing the safety constraints, and $T$ is the total number
  of action plays. We further present numerical simulations that corroborate our theoretical
  findings.
