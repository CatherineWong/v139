title: Differentiable Sorting Networks for Scalable Sorting and Ranking Supervision
abstract: Sorting and ranking supervision is a method for training neural networks
  end-to-end based on ordering constraints. That is, the ground truth order of sets
  of samples is known, while their absolute values remain unsupervised. For that,
  we propose differentiable sorting networks by relaxing their pairwise conditional
  swap operations. To address the problems of vanishing gradients and extensive blurring
  that arise with larger numbers of layers, we propose mapping activations to regions
  with moderate gradients. We consider odd-even as well as bitonic sorting networks,
  which outperform existing relaxations of the sorting operation. We show that bitonic
  sorting networks can achieve stable training on large input sets of up to 1024 elements.
