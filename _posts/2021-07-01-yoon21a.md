title: Adversarial Purification with Score-based Generative Models
abstract: While adversarial training is considered as a standard defense method against
  adversarial attacks for image classifiers, adversarial purification, which purifies
  attacked images into clean images with a standalone purification, model has shown
  promises as an alternative defense method. Recently, an EBM trained with MCMC has
  been highlighted as a purification model, where an attacked image is purified by
  running a long Markov-chain using the gradients of the EBM. Yet, the practicality
  of the adversarial purification using an EBM remains questionable because the number
  of MCMC steps required for such purification is too large. In this paper, we propose
  a novel adversarial purification method based on an EBM trained with DSM. We show
  that an EBM trained with DSM can quickly purify attacked images within a few steps.
  We further introduce a simple yet effective randomized purification scheme that
  injects random noises into images before purification. This process screens the
  adversarial perturbations imposed on images by the random noises and brings the
  images to the regime where the EBM can denoise well. We show that our purification
  method is robust against various attacks and demonstrate its state-of-the-art performances.
