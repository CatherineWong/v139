title: 'Efficient Lottery Ticket Finding: Less Data is More'
abstract: The lottery ticket hypothesis (LTH) reveals the existence of winning tickets
  (sparse but critical subnetworks) for dense networks, that can be trained in isolation
  from random initialization to match the latter’s accuracies. However, finding winning
  tickets requires burdensome computations in the train-prune-retrain process, especially
  on large-scale datasets (e.g., ImageNet), restricting their practical benefits.
  This paper explores a new perspective on finding lottery tickets more efficiently,
  by doing so only with a specially selected subset of data, called Pruning-Aware
  Critical set (PrAC set), rather than using the full training set. The concept of
  PrAC set was inspired by the recent observation, that deep networks have samples
  that are either hard to memorize during training, or easy to forget during pruning.
  A PrAC set is thus hypothesized to capture those most challenging and informative
  examples for the dense model. We observe that a high-quality winning ticket can
  be found with training and pruning the dense network on the very compact PrAC set,
  which can substantially save training iterations for the ticket finding process.
  Extensive experiments validate our proposal across diverse datasets and network
  architectures. Specifically, on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet, we locate
  effective PrAC sets at 35.32% 78.19% of their training set sizes. On top of them,
  we can obtain the same competitive winning tickets for the corresponding dense networks,
  yet saving up to 82.85% 92.77%, 63.54% 74.92%, and 76.14% 86.56% training iterations,
  respectively. Crucially, we show that a PrAC set found is reusable across different
  network architectures, which can amortize the extra cost of finding PrAC sets, yielding
  a practical regime for efficient lottery ticket finding.
