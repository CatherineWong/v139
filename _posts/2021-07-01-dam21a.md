title: Convex Regularization in Monte-Carlo Tree Search
abstract: Monte-Carlo planning and Reinforcement Learning (RL) are essential to sequential
  decision making. The recent AlphaGo and AlphaZero algorithms have shown how to successfully
  combine these two paradigms to solve large-scale sequential decision problems. These
  methodologies exploit a variant of the well-known UCT algorithm to trade off the
  exploitation of good actions and the exploration of unvisited states, but their
  empirical success comes at the cost of poor sample-efficiency and high computation
  time. In this paper, we overcome these limitations by introducing the use of convex
  regularization in Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to drive exploration efficiently
  and to improve policy updates. First, we introduce a unifying theory on the use
  of generic convex regularizers in MCTS, deriving the first regret analysis of regularized
  MCTS and showing that it guarantees an exponential convergence rate. Second, we
  exploit our theoretical framework to introduce novel regularized backup operators
  for MCTS, based on the relative entropy of the policy update and, more importantly,
  on the Tsallis entropy of the policy, for which we prove superior theoretical guarantees.
  We empirically verify the consequence of our theoretical results on a toy problem.
  Finally, we show how our framework can easily be incorporated in AlphaGo and we
  empirically show the superiority of convex regularization, w.r.t. representative
  baselines, on well-known RL problems across several Atari games.
