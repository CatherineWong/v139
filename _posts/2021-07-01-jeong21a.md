title: Objective Bound Conditional Gaussian Process for Bayesian Optimization
abstract: A Gaussian process is a standard surrogate model for an unknown objective
  function in Bayesian optimization. In this paper, we propose a new surrogate model,
  called the objective bound conditional Gaussian process (OBCGP), to condition a
  Gaussian process on a bound on the optimal function value. The bound is obtained
  and updated as the best observed value during the sequential optimization procedure.
  Unlike the standard Gaussian process, the OBCGP explicitly incorporates the existence
  of a point that improves the best known bound. We treat the location of such a point
  as a model parameter and estimate it jointly with other parameters by maximizing
  the likelihood using variational inference. Within the standard Bayesian optimization
  framework, the OBCGP can be combined with various acquisition functions to select
  the next query point. In particular, we derive cumulative regret bounds for the
  OBCGP combined with the upper confidence bound acquisition algorithm. Furthermore,
  the OBCGP can inherently incorporate a new type of prior knowledge, i.e., the bounds
  on the optimum, if it is available. The incorporation of this type of prior knowledge
  into a surrogate model has not been studied previously. We demonstrate the effectiveness
  of the OBCGP through its application to Bayesian optimization tasks, such as the
  sequential design of experiments and hyperparameter optimization in neural networks.
