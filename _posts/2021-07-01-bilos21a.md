title: Scalable Normalizing Flows for Permutation Invariant Densities
abstract: Modeling sets is an important problem in machine learning since this type
  of data can be found in many domains. A promising approach defines a family of permutation
  invariant densities with continuous normalizing flows. This allows us to maximize
  the likelihood directly and sample new realizations with ease. In this work, we
  demonstrate how calculating the trace, a crucial step in this method, raises issues
  that occur both during training and inference, limiting its practicality. We propose
  an alternative way of defining permutation equivariant transformations that give
  closed form trace. This leads not only to improvements while training, but also
  to better final performance. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach on point
  processes and general set modeling.
