title: Problem Dependent View on Structured Thresholding Bandit Problems
abstract: We investigate the \textit{problem dependent regime} in the stochastic \emph{Thresholding
  Bandit problem} (\tbp) under several \emph{shape constraints}. In the \tbp the objective
  of the learner is to output, after interacting with the environment, the set of
  arms whose means are above a given threshold. The vanilla, unstructured, case is
  already well studied in the literature. Taking $K$ as the number of arms, we consider
  the case where (i) the sequence of arm’s means $(\mu_k){k=1}^K$ is monotonically
  increasing (\textit{MTBP}) and (ii) the case where $(\mu_k){k=1}^K$ is concave (\textit{CTBP}).
  We consider both cases in the \emph{problem dependent} regime and study the probability
  of error - i.e. the probability to mis-classify at least one arm. In the fixed budget
  setting, we provide nearly matching upper and lower bounds for the probability of
  error in both the concave and monotone settings, as well as associated algorithms.
  Of interest, is that for both the monotone and concave cases, optimal bounds on
  probability of error are of the same order as those for the two armed bandit problem.
