title: Bias-Robust Bayesian Optimization via Dueling Bandits
abstract: We consider Bayesian optimization in settings where observations can be
  adversarially biased, for example by an uncontrolled hidden confounder. Our first
  contribution is a reduction of the confounded setting to the dueling bandit model.
  Then we propose a novel approach for dueling bandits based on information-directed
  sampling (IDS). Thereby, we obtain the first efficient kernelized algorithm for
  dueling bandits that comes with cumulative regret guarantees. Our analysis further
  generalizes a previously proposed semi-parametric linear bandit model to non-linear
  reward functions, and uncovers interesting links to doubly-robust estimation.
