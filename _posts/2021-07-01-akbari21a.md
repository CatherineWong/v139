title: How Does Loss Function Affect Generalization Performance of Deep Learning?
  Application to Human Age Estimation
abstract: 'Good generalization performance across a wide variety of domains caused
  by many external and internal factors is the fundamental goal of any machine learning
  algorithm. This paper theoretically proves that the choice of loss function matters
  for improving the generalization performance of deep learning-based systems. By
  deriving the generalization error bound for deep neural models trained by stochastic
  gradient descent, we pinpoint the characteristics of the loss function that is linked
  to the generalization error and can therefore be used for guiding the loss function
  selection process. In summary, our main statement in this paper is: choose a stable
  loss function, generalize better. Focusing on human age estimation from the face
  which is a challenging topic in computer vision, we then propose a novel loss function
  for this learning problem. We theoretically prove that the proposed loss function
  achieves stronger stability, and consequently a tighter generalization error bound,
  compared to the other common loss functions for this problem. We have supported
  our findings theoretically, and demonstrated the merits of the guidance process
  experimentally, achieving significant improvements.'
