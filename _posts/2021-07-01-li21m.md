title: A Novel Method to Solve Neural Knapsack Problems
abstract: 0-1 knapsack is of fundamental importance across many fields. In this paper,
  we present a game-theoretic method to solve 0-1 knapsack problems (KPs) where the
  number of items (products) is large and the values of items are not predetermined
  but decided by an external value assignment function (e.g., a neural network in
  our case) during the optimization process. While existing papers are interested
  in predicting solutions with neural networks for classical KPs whose objective functions
  are mostly linear functions, we are interested in solving KPs whose objective functions
  are neural networks. In other words, we choose a subset of items that maximize the
  sum of the values predicted by neural networks. Its key challenge is how to optimize
  the neural network-based non-linear KP objective with a budget constraint. Our solution
  is inspired by game-theoretic approaches in deep learning, e.g., generative adversarial
  networks. After formally defining our two-player game, we develop an adaptive gradient
  ascent method to solve it. In our experiments, our method successfully solves two
  neural network-based non-linear KPs and conventional linear KPs with 1 million items.
