title: 'Beyond Variance Reduction: Understanding the True Impact of Baselines on Policy
  Optimization'
abstract: Bandit and reinforcement learning (RL) problems can often be framed as optimization
  problems where the goal is to maximize average performance while having access only
  to stochastic estimates of the true gradient. Traditionally, stochastic optimization
  theory predicts that learning dynamics are governed by the curvature of the loss
  function and the noise of the gradient estimates. In this paper we demonstrate that
  the standard view is too limited for bandit and RL problems. To allow our analysis
  to be interpreted in light of multi-step MDPs, we focus on techniques derived from
  stochastic optimization principlesÂ (e.g., natural policy gradient and EXP3) and
  we show that some standard assumptions from optimization theory are violated in
  these problems. We present theoretical results showing that, at least for bandit
  problems, curvature and noise are not sufficient to explain the learning dynamics
  and that seemingly innocuous choices like the baseline can determine whether an
  algorithm converges. These theoretical findings match our empirical evaluation,
  which we extend to multi-state MDPs.
