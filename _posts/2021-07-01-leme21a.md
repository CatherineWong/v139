title: Learning to Price Against a Moving Target
abstract: In the Learning to Price setting, a seller posts prices over time with the
  goal of maximizing revenue while learning the buyer’s valuation. This problem is
  very well understood when values are stationary (fixed or iid). Here we study the
  problem where the buyer’s value is a moving target, i.e., they change over time
  either by a stochastic process or adversarially with bounded variation. In either
  case, we provide matching upper and lower bounds on the optimal revenue loss. Since
  the target is moving, any information learned soon becomes out-dated, which forces
  the algorithms to keep switching between exploring and exploiting phases.
