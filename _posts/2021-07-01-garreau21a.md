title: What does LIME really see in images?
abstract: The performance of modern algorithms on certain computer vision tasks such
  as object recognition is now close to that of humans. This success was achieved
  at the price of complicated architectures depending on millions of parameters and
  it has become quite challenging to understand how particular predictions are made.
  Interpretability methods propose to give us this understanding. In this paper, we
  study LIME, perhaps one of the most popular. On the theoretical side, we show that
  when the number of generated examples is large, LIME explanations are concentrated
  around a limit explanation for which we give an explicit expression. We further
  this study for elementary shape detectors and linear models. As a consequence of
  this analysis, we uncover a connection between LIME and integrated gradients, another
  explanation method. More precisely, the LIME explanations are similar to the sum
  of integrated gradients over the superpixels used in the preprocessing step of LIME.
