title: Reasoning Over Virtual Knowledge Bases With Open Predicate Relations
abstract: We present the Open Predicate Query Language (OPQL); a method for constructing
  a virtual KB (VKB) trained entirely from text. Large Knowledge Bases (KBs) are indispensable
  for a wide-range of industry applications such as question answering and recommendation.
  Typically, KBs encode world knowledge in a structured, readily accessible form derived
  from laborious human annotation efforts. Unfortunately, while they are extremely
  high precision, KBs are inevitably highly incomplete and automated methods for enriching
  them are far too inaccurate. Instead, OPQL constructs a VKB by encoding and indexing
  a set of relation mentions in a way that naturally enables reasoning and can be
  trained without any structured supervision. We demonstrate that OPQL outperforms
  prior VKB methods on two different KB reasoning tasks and, additionally, can be
  used as an external memory integrated into a language model (OPQL-LM) leading to
  improvements on two open-domain question answering tasks.
