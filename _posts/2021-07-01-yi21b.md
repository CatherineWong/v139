title: Regret and Cumulative Constraint Violation Analysis for Online Convex Optimization
  with Long Term Constraints
abstract: This paper considers online convex optimization with long term constraints,
  where constraints can be violated in intermediate rounds, but need to be satisfied
  in the long run. The cumulative constraint violation is used as the metric to measure
  constraint violations, which excludes the situation that strictly feasible constraints
  can compensate the effects of violated constraints. A novel algorithm is first proposed
  and it achieves an $\mathcal{O}(T^{\max\{c,1-c\}})$ bound for static regret and
  an $\mathcal{O}(T^{(1-c)/2})$ bound for cumulative constraint violation, where $c\in(0,1)$
  is a user-defined trade-off parameter, and thus has improved performance compared
  with existing results. Both static regret and cumulative constraint violation bounds
  are reduced to $\mathcal{O}(\log(T))$ when the loss functions are strongly convex,
  which also improves existing results. %In order to bound the regret with respect
  to any comparator sequence, In order to achieve the optimal regret with respect
  to any comparator sequence, another algorithm is then proposed and it achieves the
  optimal $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T(1+P_T)})$ regret and an $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ cumulative
  constraint violation, where $P_T$ is the path-length of the comparator sequence.
  Finally, numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the
  theoretical results.
