title: 'NeRF-VAE: A Geometry Aware 3D Scene Generative Model'
abstract: We propose NeRF-VAE, a 3D scene generative model that incorporates geometric
  structure via Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and differentiable volume rendering.
  In contrast to NeRF, our model takes into account shared structure across scenes,
  and is able to infer the structure of a novel scene—without the need to re-train—using
  amortized inference. NeRF-VAE’s explicit 3D rendering process further contrasts
  previous generative models with convolution-based rendering which lacks geometric
  structure. Our model is a VAE that learns a distribution over radiance fields by
  conditioning them on a latent scene representation. We show that, once trained,
  NeRF-VAE is able to infer and render geometrically-consistent scenes from previously
  unseen 3D environments of synthetic scenes using very few input images. We further
  demonstrate that NeRF-VAE generalizes well to out-of-distribution cameras, while
  convolutional models do not. Finally, we introduce and study an attention-based
  conditioning mechanism of NeRF-VAE’s decoder, which improves model performance.
