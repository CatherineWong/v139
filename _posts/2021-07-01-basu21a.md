title: Beyond $log^2(T)$ regret for decentralized bandits in matching markets
abstract: We design decentralized algorithms for regret minimization in the two sided
  matching market with one-sided bandit feedback that significantly improves upon
  the prior works (Liu et al.\,2020a, Sankararaman et al.\,2020, Liu et al.\,2020b).
  First, for general markets, for any $\varepsilon > 0$, we design an algorithm that
  achieves a $O(\log^{1+\varepsilon}(T))$ regret to the agent-optimal stable matching,
  with unknown time horizon $T$, improving upon the $O(\log^{2}(T))$ regret achieved
  in (Liu et al.\,2020b). Second, we provide the optimal $\Theta(\log(T))$ agent-optimal
  regret for markets satisfying {\em uniqueness consistency} – markets where leaving
  participants don’t alter the original stable matching. Previously, $\Theta(\log(T))$
  regret was achievable (Sankararaman et al.\,2020, Liu et al.\,2020b) in the much
  restricted {\em serial dictatorship} setting, when all arms have the same preference
  over the agents. We propose a phase based algorithm, where in each phase, besides
  deleting the globally communicated dominated arms the agents locally delete arms
  with which they collide often. This \emph{local deletion} is pivotal in breaking
  deadlocks arising from rank heterogeneity of agents across arms. We further demonstrate
  superiority of our algorithm over existing works through simulations.
