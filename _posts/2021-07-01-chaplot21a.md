title: Differentiable Spatial Planning using Transformers
abstract: We consider the problem of spatial path planning. In contrast to the classical
  solutions which optimize a new plan from scratch and assume access to the full map
  with ground truth obstacle locations, we learn a planner from the data in a differentiable
  manner that allows us to leverage statistical regularities from past data. We propose
  Spatial Planning Transformers (SPT), which given an obstacle map learns to generate
  actions by planning over long-range spatial dependencies, unlike prior data-driven
  planners that propagate information locally via convolutional structure in an iterative
  manner. In the setting where the ground truth map is not known to the agent, we
  leverage pre-trained SPTs in an end-to-end framework that has the structure of mapper
  and planner built into it which allows seamless generalization to out-of-distribution
  maps and goals. SPTs outperform prior state-of-the-art differentiable planners across
  all the setups for both manipulation and navigation tasks, leading to an absolute
  improvement of 7-19%.
