title: Watermarking Deep Neural Networks with Greedy Residuals
abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are considered as intellectual property of their
  corresponding owners and thus are in urgent need of ownership protection, due to
  the massive amount of time and resources invested in designing, tuning and training
  them. In this paper, we propose a novel watermark-based ownership protection method
  by using the residuals of important parameters. Different from other watermark-based
  ownership protection methods that rely on some specific neural network architectures
  and during verification require external data source, namely ownership indicators,
  our method does not explicitly use ownership indicators for verification to defeat
  various attacks against DNN watermarks. Specifically, we greedily select a few and
  important model parameters for embedding so that the impairment caused by the changed
  parameters can be reduced and the robustness against different attacks can be improved
  as the selected parameters can well preserve the model information. Also, without
  the external data sources for verification, the adversary can hardly cast doubts
  on ownership verification by forging counterfeit watermarks. The extensive experiments
  show that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in five tasks.
