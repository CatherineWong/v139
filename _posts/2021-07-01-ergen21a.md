title: 'Global Optimality Beyond Two Layers: Training Deep ReLU Networks via Convex
  Programs'
abstract: Understanding the fundamental mechanism behind the success of deep neural
  networks is one of the key challenges in the modern machine learning literature.
  Despite numerous attempts, a solid theoretical analysis is yet to be developed.
  In this paper, we develop a novel unified framework to reveal a hidden regularization
  mechanism through the lens of convex optimization. We first show that the training
  of multiple three-layer ReLU sub-networks with weight decay regularization can be
  equivalently cast as a convex optimization problem in a higher dimensional space,
  where sparsity is enforced via a group $\ell_1$-norm regularization. Consequently,
  ReLU networks can be interpreted as high dimensional feature selection methods.
  More importantly, we then prove that the equivalent convex problem can be globally
  optimized by a standard convex optimization solver with a polynomial-time complexity
  with respect to the number of samples and data dimension when the width of the network
  is fixed. Finally, we numerically validate our theoretical results via experiments
  involving both synthetic and real datasets.
