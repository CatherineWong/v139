title: Inference for Network Regression Models with Community Structure
abstract: Network regression models, where the outcome comprises the valued edge in
  a network and the predictors are actor or dyad-level covariates, are used extensively
  in the social and biological sciences. Valid inference relies on accurately modeling
  the residual dependencies among the relations. Frequently homogeneity assumptions
  are placed on the errors which are commonly incorrect and ignore critical natural
  clustering of the actors. In this work, we present a novel regression modeling framework
  that models the errors as resulting from a community-based dependence structure
  and exploits the subsequent exchangeability properties of the error distribution
  to obtain parsimonious standard errors for regression parameters.
