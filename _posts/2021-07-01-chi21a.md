title: Understanding and Mitigating Accuracy Disparity in Regression
abstract: With the widespread deployment of large-scale prediction systems in high-stakes
  domains, e.g., face recognition, criminal justice, etc., disparity on prediction
  accuracy between different demographic subgroups has called for fundamental understanding
  on the source of such disparity and algorithmic intervention to mitigate it. In
  this paper, we study the accuracy disparity problem in regression. To begin with,
  we first propose an error decomposition theorem, which decomposes the accuracy disparity
  into the distance between marginal label distributions and the distance between
  conditional representations, to help explain why such accuracy disparity appears
  in practice. Motivated by this error decomposition and the general idea of distribution
  alignment with statistical distances, we then propose an algorithm to reduce this
  disparity, and analyze its game-theoretic optima of the proposed objective functions.
  To corroborate our theoretical findings, we also conduct experiments on five benchmark
  datasets. The experimental results suggest that our proposed algorithms can effectively
  mitigate accuracy disparity while maintaining the predictive power of the regression
  models.
