title: Toward Better Generalization Bounds with Locally Elastic Stability
abstract: Algorithmic stability is a key characteristic to ensure the generalization
  ability of a learning algorithm. Among different notions of stability, \emph{uniform
  stability} is arguably the most popular one, which yields exponential generalization
  bounds. However, uniform stability only considers the worst-case loss change (or
  so-called sensitivity) by removing a single data point, which is distribution-independent
  and therefore undesirable. There are many cases that the worst-case sensitivity
  of the loss is much larger than the average sensitivity taken over the single data
  point that is removed, especially in some advanced models such as random feature
  models or neural networks. Many previous works try to mitigate the distribution
  independent issue by proposing weaker notions of stability, however, they either
  only yield polynomial bounds or the bounds derived do not vanish as sample size
  goes to infinity. Given that, we propose \emph{locally elastic stability} as a weaker
  and distribution-dependent stability notion, which still yields exponential generalization
  bounds. We further demonstrate that locally elastic stability implies tighter generalization
  bounds than those derived based on uniform stability in many situations by revisiting
  the examples of bounded support vector machines, regularized least square regressions,
  and stochastic gradient descent.
