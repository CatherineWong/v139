title: Compositional Video Synthesis with Action Graphs
abstract: Videos of actions are complex signals containing rich compositional structure
  in space and time. Current video generation methods lack the ability to condition
  the generation on multiple coordinated and potentially simultaneous timed actions.
  To address this challenge, we propose to represent the actions in a graph structure
  called Action Graph and present the new "Action Graph To Video" synthesis task.
  Our generative model for this task (AG2Vid) disentangles motion and appearance features,
  and by incorporating a scheduling mechanism for actions facilitates a timely and
  coordinated video generation. We train and evaluate AG2Vid on CATER and Something-Something
  V2 datasets, which results in videos that have better visual quality and semantic
  consistency compared to baselines. Finally, our model demonstrates zero-shot abilities
  by synthesizing novel compositions of the learned actions.
