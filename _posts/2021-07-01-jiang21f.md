title: Single Pass Entrywise-Transformed Low Rank Approximation
abstract: In applications such as natural language processing or computer vision,
  one is given a large $n \times n$ matrix $A = (a_{i,j})$ and would like to compute
  a matrix decomposition, e.g., a low rank approximation, of a function $f(A) = (f(a_{i,j}))$
  applied entrywise to $A$. A very important special case is the likelihood function
  $f\left( A \right ) = \log{\left( \left| a_{ij}\right| +1\right)}$. A natural way
  to do this would be to simply apply $f$ to each entry of $A$, and then compute the
  matrix decomposition, but this requires storing all of $A$ as well as multiple passes
  over its entries. Recent work of Liang et al. shows how to find a rank-$k$ factorization
  to $f(A)$ using only $n \cdot \poly(\eps^{-1}k\log n)$ words of memory, with overall
  error $10\|f(A)-[f(A)]_k\|_F^2 + \poly(\epsilon/k) \|f(A)\|_{1,2}^2$, where $[f(A)]_k$
  is the best rank-$k$ approximation to $f(A)$ and $\|f(A)\|_{1,2}^2$ is the square
  of the sum of Euclidean lengths of rows of $f(A)$. Their algorithm uses $3$ passes
  over the entries of $A$. The authors pose the open question of obtaining an algorithm
  with $n \cdot \poly(\eps^{-1}k\log n)$ words of memory using only a single pass
  over the entries of $A$. In this paper we resolve this open question, obtaining
  the first single-pass algorithm for this problem and for the same class of functions
  $f$ studied by Liang et al. Moreover, our error is $\|f(A)-[f(A)]_k\|_F^2 + \poly(\epsilon/k)
  \|f(A)\|_F^2$, where $\|f(A)\|_F^2$ is the sum of squares of Euclidean lengths of
  rows of $f(A)$. Thus our error is significantly smaller, as it removes the factor
  of $10$ and also $\|f(A)\|_F^2 \leq \|f(A)\|_{1,2}^2$.
