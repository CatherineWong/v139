title: Geometric convergence of elliptical slice sampling
abstract: For Bayesian learning, given likelihood function and Gaussian prior, the
  elliptical slice sampler, introduced by Murray, Adams and MacKay 2010, provides
  a tool for the construction of a Markov chain for approximate sampling of the underlying
  posterior distribution. Besides of its wide applicability and simplicity its main
  feature is that no tuning is necessary. Under weak regularity assumptions on the
  posterior density we show that the corresponding Markov chain is geometrically ergodic
  and therefore yield qualitative convergence guarantees. We illustrate our result
  for Gaussian posteriors as they appear in Gaussian process regression in a fully
  Gaussian scenario, which for example is exhibited in Gaussian process regression,
  as well as in a setting of a multi-modal distribution. Remarkably, our numerical
  experiments indicate a dimension-independent performance of elliptical slice sampling
  even in situations where our ergodicity result does not apply.
