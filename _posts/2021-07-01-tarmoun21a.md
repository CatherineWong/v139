title: Understanding the Dynamics of Gradient Flow in Overparameterized Linear models
abstract: We provide a detailed analysis of the dynamics ofthe gradient flow in overparameterized
  two-layerlinear models. A particularly interesting featureof this model is that
  its nonlinear dynamics can beexactly solved as a consequence of a large num-ber
  of conservation laws that constrain the systemto follow particular trajectories.
  More precisely,the gradient flow preserves the difference of theGramian matrices
  of the input and output weights,and its convergence to equilibrium depends onboth
  the magnitude of that difference (which isfixed at initialization) and the spectrum
  of the data.In addition, and generalizing prior work, we proveour results without
  assuming small, balanced orspectral initialization for the weights. Moreover,we
  establish interesting mathematical connectionsbetween matrix factorization problems
  and differ-ential equations of the Riccati type.
