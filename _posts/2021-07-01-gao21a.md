title: An Information-Geometric Distance on the Space of Tasks
abstract: This paper prescribes a distance between learning tasks modeled as joint
  distributions on data and labels. Using tools in information geometry, the distance
  is defined to be the length of the shortest weight trajectory on a Riemannian manifold
  as a classifier is fitted on an interpolated task. The interpolated task evolves
  from the source to the target task using an optimal transport formulation. This
  distance, which we call the "coupled transfer distance" can be compared across different
  classifier architectures. We develop an algorithm to compute the distance which
  iteratively transports the marginal on the data of the source task to that of the
  target task while updating the weights of the classifier to track this evolving
  data distribution. We develop theory to show that our distance captures the intuitive
  idea that a good transfer trajectory is the one that keeps the generalization gap
  small during transfer, in particular at the end on the target task. We perform thorough
  empirical validation and analysis across diverse image classification datasets to
  show that the coupled transfer distance correlates strongly with the difficulty
  of fine-tuning.
