title: Fast Projection Onto Convex Smooth Constraints
abstract: The Euclidean projection onto a convex set is an important problem that
  arises in numerous constrained optimization tasks. Unfortunately, in many cases,
  computing projections is computationally demanding. In this work, we focus on projection
  problems where the constraints are smooth and the number of constraints is significantly
  smaller than the dimension. The runtime of existing approaches to solving such problems
  is either cubic in the dimension or polynomial in the inverse of the target accuracy.
  Conversely, we propose a simple and efficient primal-dual approach, with a runtime
  that scales only linearly with the dimension, and only logarithmically in the inverse
  of the target accuracy. We empirically demonstrate its performance, and compare
  it with standard baselines.
