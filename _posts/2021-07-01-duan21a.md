title: Risk Bounds and Rademacher Complexity in Batch Reinforcement Learning
abstract: 'This paper considers batch Reinforcement Learning (RL) with general value
  function approximation. Our study investigates the minimal assumptions to reliably
  estimate/minimize Bellman error, and characterizes the generalization performance
  by (local) Rademacher complexities of general function classes, which makes initial
  steps in bridging the gap between statistical learning theory and batch RL. Concretely,
  we view the Bellman error as a surrogate loss for the optimality gap, and prove
  the followings: (1) In double sampling regime, the excess risk of Empirical Risk
  Minimizer (ERM) is bounded by the Rademacher complexity of the function class. (2)
  In the single sampling regime, sample-efficient risk minimization is not possible
  without further assumptions, regardless of algorithms. However, with completeness
  assumptions, the excess risk of FQI and a minimax style algorithm can be again bounded
  by the Rademacher complexity of the corresponding function classes. (3) Fast statistical
  rates can be achieved by using tools of local Rademacher complexity. Our analysis
  covers a wide range of function classes, including finite classes, linear spaces,
  kernel spaces, sparse linear features, etc.'
