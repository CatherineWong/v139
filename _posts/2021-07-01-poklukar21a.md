title: 'GeomCA: Geometric Evaluation of Data Representations'
abstract: Evaluating the quality of learned representations without relying on a downstream
  task remains one of the challenges in representation learning. In this work, we
  present Geometric Component Analysis (GeomCA) algorithm that evaluates representation
  spaces based on their geometric and topological properties. GeomCA can be applied
  to representations of any dimension, independently of the model that generated them.
  We demonstrate its applicability by analyzing representations obtained from a variety
  of scenarios, such as contrastive learning models, generative models and supervised
  learning models.
