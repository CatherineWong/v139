title: 'A Free Lunch From ANN: Towards Efficient, Accurate Spiking Neural Networks
  Calibration'
abstract: Spiking Neural Network (SNN) has been recognized as one of the next generation
  of neural networks. Conventionally, SNN can be converted from a pre-trained ANN
  by only replacing the ReLU activation to spike activation while keeping the parameters
  intact. Perhaps surprisingly, in this work we show that a proper way to calibrate
  the parameters during the conversion of ANN to SNN can bring significant improvements.
  We introduce SNN Calibration, a cheap but extraordinarily effective method by leveraging
  the knowledge within a pre-trained Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Starting by
  analyzing the conversion error and its propagation through layers theoretically,
  we propose the calibration algorithm that can correct the error layer-by-layer.
  The calibration only takes a handful number of training data and several minutes
  to finish. Moreover, our calibration algorithm can produce SNN with state-of-the-art
  architecture on the large-scale ImageNet dataset, including MobileNet and RegNet.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm.
  For example, our advanced pipeline can increase up to 69% top-1 accuracy when converting
  MobileNet on ImageNet compared to baselines. Codes are released at https://github.com/yhhhli/SNN_Calibration.
