title: 'Meta-StyleSpeech : Multi-Speaker Adaptive Text-to-Speech Generation'
abstract: With rapid progress in neural text-to-speech (TTS) models, personalized
  speech generation is now in high demand for many applications. For practical applicability,
  a TTS model should generate high-quality speech with only a few audio samples from
  the given speaker, that are also short in length. However, existing methods either
  require to fine-tune the model or achieve low adaptation quality without fine-tuning.
  In this work, we propose StyleSpeech, a new TTS model which not only synthesizes
  high-quality speech but also effectively adapts to new speakers. Specifically, we
  propose Style-Adaptive Layer Normalization (SALN) which aligns gain and bias of
  the text input according to the style extracted from a reference speech audio. With
  SALN, our model effectively synthesizes speech in the style of the target speaker
  even from a single speech audio. Furthermore, to enhance StyleSpeech’s adaptation
  to speech from new speakers, we extend it to Meta-StyleSpeech by introducing two
  discriminators trained with style prototypes, and performing episodic training.
  The experimental results show that our models generate high-quality speech which
  accurately follows the speaker’s voice with single short-duration (1-3 sec) speech
  audio, significantly outperforming baselines.
