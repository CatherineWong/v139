title: 'Deciding What to Learn: A Rate-Distortion Approach'
abstract: Agents that learn to select optimal actions represent a prominent focus
  of the sequential decision-making literature. In the face of a complex environment
  or constraints on time and resources, however, aiming to synthesize such an optimal
  policy can become infeasible. These scenarios give rise to an important trade-off
  between the information an agent must acquire to learn and the sub-optimality of
  the resulting policy. While an agent designer has a preference for how this trade-off
  is resolved, existing approaches further require that the designer translate these
  preferences into a fixed learning target for the agent. In this work, leveraging
  rate-distortion theory, we automate this process such that the designer need only
  express their preferences via a single hyperparameter and the agent is endowed with
  the ability to compute its own learning targets that best achieve the desired trade-off.
  We establish a general bound on expected discounted regret for an agent that decides
  what to learn in this manner along with computational experiments that illustrate
  the expressiveness of designer preferences and even show improvements over Thompson
  sampling in identifying an optimal policy.
