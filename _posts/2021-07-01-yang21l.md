title: Rethinking Rotated Object Detection with Gaussian Wasserstein Distance Loss
abstract: Boundary discontinuity and its inconsistency to the final detection metric
  have been the bottleneck for rotating detection regression loss design. In this
  paper, we propose a novel regression loss based on Gaussian Wasserstein distance
  as a fundamental approach to solve the problem. Specifically, the rotated bounding
  box is converted to a 2-D Gaussian distribution, which enables to approximate the
  indifferentiable rotational IoU induced loss by the Gaussian Wasserstein distance
  (GWD) which can be learned efficiently by gradient back-propagation. GWD can still
  be informative for learning even there is no overlapping between two rotating bounding
  boxes which is often the case for small object detection. Thanks to its three unique
  properties, GWD can also elegantly solve the boundary discontinuity and square-like
  problem regardless how the bounding box is defined. Experiments on five datasets
  using different detectors show the effectiveness of our approach, and codes are
  available at https://github.com/yangxue0827/RotationDetection.
