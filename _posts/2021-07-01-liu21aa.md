title: 'Lottery Ticket Preserves Weight Correlation: Is It Desirable or Not?'
abstract: In deep model compression, the recent finding "Lottery Ticket Hypothesis"
  (LTH) pointed out that there could exist a winning ticket (i.e., a properly pruned
  sub-network together with original weight initialization) that can achieve competitive
  performance than the original dense network. However, it is not easy to observe
  such winning property in many scenarios, where for example, a relatively large learning
  rate is used even if it benefits training the original dense model. In this work,
  we investigate the underlying condition and rationale behind the winning property,
  and find that the underlying reason is largely attributed to the correlation between
  initialized weights and final-trained weights when the learning rate is not sufficiently
  large. Thus, the existence of winning property is correlated with an insufficient
  DNN pretraining, and is unlikely to occur for a well-trained DNN. To overcome this
  limitation, we propose the "pruning & fine-tuning" method that consistently outperforms
  lottery ticket sparse training under the same pruning algorithm and the same total
  training epochs. Extensive experiments over multiple deep models (VGG, ResNet, MobileNet-v2)
  on different datasets have been conducted to justify our proposals.
