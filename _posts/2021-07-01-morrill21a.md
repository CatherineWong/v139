title: Efficient Deviation Types and Learning for Hindsight Rationality in Extensive-Form
  Games
abstract: Hindsight rationality is an approach to playing general-sum games that prescribes
  no-regret learning dynamics for individual agents with respect to a set of deviations,
  and further describes jointly rational behavior among multiple agents with mediated
  equilibria. To develop hindsight rational learning in sequential decision-making
  settings, we formalize behavioral deviations as a general class of deviations that
  respect the structure of extensive-form games. Integrating the idea of time selection
  into counterfactual regret minimization (CFR), we introduce the extensive-form regret
  minimization (EFR) algorithm that achieves hindsight rationality for any given set
  of behavioral deviations with computation that scales closely with the complexity
  of the set. We identify behavioral deviation subsets, the partial sequence deviation
  types, that subsume previously studied types and lead to efficient EFR instances
  in games with moderate lengths. In addition, we present a thorough empirical analysis
  of EFR instantiated with different deviation types in benchmark games, where we
  find that stronger types typically induce better performance.
