title: Characterizing Structural Regularities of Labeled Data in Overparameterized
  Models
abstract: Humans are accustomed to environments that contain both regularities and
  exceptions. For example, at most gas stations, one pays prior to pumping, but the
  occasional rural station does not accept payment in advance. Likewise, deep neural
  networks can generalize across instances that share common patterns or structures,
  yet have the capacity to memorize rare or irregular forms. We analyze how individual
  instances are treated by a model via a consistency score. The score characterizes
  the expected accuracy for a held-out instance given training sets of varying size
  sampled from the data distribution. We obtain empirical estimates of this score
  for individual instances in multiple data sets, and we show that the score identifies
  out-of-distribution and mislabeled examples at one end of the continuum and strongly
  regular examples at the other end. We identify computationally inexpensive proxies
  to the consistency score using statistics collected during training. We apply the
  score toward understanding the dynamics of representation learning and to filter
  outliers during training.
