title: Sparse Bayesian Learning via Stepwise Regression
abstract: Sparse Bayesian Learning (SBL) is a powerful framework for attaining sparsity
  in probabilistic models. Herein, we propose a coordinate ascent algorithm for SBL
  termed Relevance Matching Pursuit (RMP) and show that, as its noise variance parameter
  goes to zero, RMP exhibits a surprising connection to Stepwise Regression. Further,
  we derive novel guarantees for Stepwise Regression algorithms, which also shed light
  on RMP. Our guarantees for Forward Regression improve on deterministic and probabilistic
  results for Orthogonal Matching Pursuit with noise. Our analysis of Backward Regression
  culminates in a bound on the residual of the optimal solution to the subset selection
  problem that, if satisfied, guarantees the optimality of the result. To our knowledge,
  this bound is the first that can be computed in polynomial time and depends chiefly
  on the smallest singular value of the matrix. We report numerical experiments using
  a variety of feature selection algorithms. Notably, RMP and its limiting variant
  are both efficient and maintain strong performance with correlated features.
