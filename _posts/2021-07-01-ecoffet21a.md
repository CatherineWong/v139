title: Reinforcement Learning Under Moral Uncertainty
abstract: 'An ambitious goal for machine learning is to create agents that behave
  ethically: The capacity to abide by human moral norms would greatly expand the context
  in which autonomous agents could be practically and safely deployed, e.g. fully
  autonomous vehicles will encounter charged moral decisions that complicate their
  deployment. While ethical agents could be trained by rewarding correct behavior
  under a specific moral theory (e.g. utilitarianism), there remains widespread disagreement
  about the nature of morality. Acknowledging such disagreement, recent work in moral
  philosophy proposes that ethical behavior requires acting under moral uncertainty,
  i.e. to take into account when acting that oneâ€™s credence is split across several
  plausible ethical theories. This paper translates such insights to the field of
  reinforcement learning, proposes two training methods that realize different points
  among competing desiderata, and trains agents in simple environments to act under
  moral uncertainty. The results illustrate (1) how such uncertainty can help curb
  extreme behavior from commitment to single theories and (2) several technical complications
  arising from attempting to ground moral philosophy in RL (e.g. how can a principled
  trade-off between two competing but incomparable reward functions be reached). The
  aim is to catalyze progress towards morally-competent agents and highlight the potential
  of RL to contribute towards the computational grounding of moral philosophy.'
