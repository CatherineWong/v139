title: Improved Corruption Robust Algorithms for Episodic Reinforcement Learning
abstract: We study episodic reinforcement learning under unknown adversarial corruptions
  in both the rewards and the transition probabilities of the underlying system. We
  propose new algorithms which, compared to the existing results in \cite{lykouris2020corruption},
  achieve strictly better regret bounds in terms of total corruptions for the tabular
  setting. To be specific, firstly, our regret bounds depend on more precise numerical
  values of total rewards corruptions and transition corruptions, instead of only
  on the total number of corrupted episodes. Secondly, our regret bounds are the first
  of their kind in the reinforcement learning setting to have the number of corruptions
  show up additively with respect to $\min\{ \sqrt{T},\text{PolicyGapComplexity} \}$
  rather than multiplicatively. Our results follow from a general algorithmic framework
  that combines corruption-robust policy elimination meta-algorithms, and plug-in
  reward-free exploration sub-algorithms. Replacing the meta-algorithm or sub-algorithm
  may extend the framework to address other corrupted settings with potentially more
  structure.
