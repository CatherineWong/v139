title: Differentially Private Query Release Through Adaptive Projection
abstract: We propose, implement, and evaluate a new algo-rithm for releasing answers
  to very large numbersof statistical queries likek-way marginals, sub-ject to differential
  privacy. Our algorithm makesadaptive use of a continuous relaxation of thePro-jection
  Mechanism, which answers queries on theprivate dataset using simple perturbation,
  and thenattempts to find the synthetic dataset that mostclosely matches the noisy
  answers. We use a con-tinuous relaxation of the synthetic dataset domainwhich makes
  the projection loss differentiable,and allows us to use efficient ML optimizationtechniques
  and tooling. Rather than answering allqueries up front, we make judicious use of
  ourprivacy budget by iteratively finding queries forwhich our (relaxed) synthetic
  data has high error,and then repeating the projection. Randomizedrounding allows
  us to obtain synthetic data in theoriginal schema. We perform experimental evalu-ations
  across a range of parameters and datasets,and find that our method outperforms existingalgorithms
  on large query classes.
