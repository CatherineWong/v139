title: Optimal Streaming Algorithms for Multi-Armed Bandits
abstract: This paper studies two variants of the best arm identification (BAI) problem
  under the streaming model, where we have a stream of n arms with reward distributions
  supported on [0,1] with unknown means. The arms in the stream are arriving one by
  one, and the algorithm cannot access an arm unless it is stored in a limited size
  memory. We first study the streaming \epslion-topk-arms identification problem,
  which asks for k arms whose reward means are lower than that of the k-th best arm
  by at most \epsilon with probability at least 1-\delta. For general \epsilon \in
  (0,1), the existing solution for this problem assumes k = 1 and achieves the optimal
  sample complexity O(\frac{n}{\epsilon^2} \log \frac{1}{\delta}) using O(\log^*(n))
  memory and a single pass of the stream. We propose an algorithm that works for any
  k and achieves the optimal sample complexity O(\frac{n}{\epsilon^2} \log\frac{k}{\delta})
  using a single-arm memory and a single pass of the stream. Second, we study the
  streaming BAI problem, where the objective is to identify the arm with the maximum
  reward mean with at least 1-\delta probability, using a single-arm memory and as
  few passes of the input stream as possible. We present a single-arm-memory algorithm
  that achieves a near instance-dependent optimal sample complexity within O(\log
  \Delta_2^{-1}) passes, where \Delta_2 is the gap between the mean of the best arm
  and that of the second best arm.
