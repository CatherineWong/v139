title: 'Online Optimization in Games via Control Theory: Connecting Regret, Passivity
  and Poincaré Recurrence'
abstract: We present a novel control-theoretic understanding of online optimization
  and learning in games, via the notion of passivity. Passivity is a fundamental concept
  in control theory, which abstracts energy conservation and dissipation in physical
  systems. It has become a standard tool in analysis of general feedback systems,
  to which game dynamics belong. Our starting point is to show that all continuous-time
  Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) dynamics, which include the well-known Replicator
  Dynamic, are lossless, i.e. it is passive with no energy dissipation. Interestingly,
  we prove that passivity implies bounded regret, connecting two fundamental primitives
  of control theory and online optimization. The observation of energy conservation
  in FTRL inspires us to present a family of lossless learning dynamics, each of which
  has an underlying energy function with a simple gradient structure. This family
  is closed under convex combination; as an immediate corollary, any convex combination
  of FTRL dynamics is lossless and thus has bounded regret. This allows us to extend
  the framework of Fox & Shamma [Games 2013] to prove not just global asymptotic stability
  results for game dynamics, but Poincar{é} recurrence results as well. Intuitively,
  when a lossless game (e.g. graphical constant-sum game) is coupled with lossless
  learning dynamic, their interconnection is also lossless, which results in a pendulum-like
  energy-preserving recurrent behavior, generalizing Piliouras & Shamma [SODA 2014]
  and Mertikopoulos et al. [SODA 2018].
