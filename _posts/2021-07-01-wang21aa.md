title: Learning to Weight Imperfect Demonstrations
abstract: This paper investigates how to weight imperfect expert demonstrations for
  generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL). The agent is expected to perform
  behaviors demonstrated by experts. But in many applications, experts could also
  make mistakes and their demonstrations would mislead or slow the learning process
  of the agent. Recently, existing methods for imitation learning from imperfect demonstrations
  mostly focus on using the preference or confidence scores to distinguish imperfect
  demonstrations. However, these auxiliary information needs to be collected with
  the help of an oracle, which is usually hard and expensive to afford in practice.
  In contrast, this paper proposes a method of learning to weight imperfect demonstrations
  in GAIL without imposing extensive prior information. We provide a rigorous mathematical
  analysis, presenting that the weights of demonstrations can be exactly determined
  by combining the discriminator and agent policy in GAIL. Theoretical analysis suggests
  that with the estimated weights the agent can learn a better policy beyond those
  plain expert demonstrations. Experiments in the Mujoco and Atari environments demonstrate
  that the proposed algorithm outperforms baseline methods in handling imperfect expert
  demonstrations.
