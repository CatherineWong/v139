title: 'CRPO: A New Approach for Safe Reinforcement Learning with Convergence Guarantee'
abstract: In safe reinforcement learning (SRL) problems, an agent explores the environment
  to maximize an expected total reward and meanwhile avoids violation of certain constraints
  on a number of expected total costs. In general, such SRL problems have nonconvex
  objective functions subject to multiple nonconvex constraints, and hence are very
  challenging to solve, particularly to provide a globally optimal policy. Many popular
  SRL algorithms adopt a primal-dual structure which utilizes the updating of dual
  variables for satisfying the constraints. In contrast, we propose a primal approach,
  called constraint-rectified policy optimization (CRPO), which updates the policy
  alternatingly between objective improvement and constraint satisfaction. CRPO provides
  a primal-type algorithmic framework to solve SRL problems, where each policy update
  can take any variant of policy optimization step. To demonstrate the theoretical
  performance of CRPO, we adopt natural policy gradient (NPG) for each policy update
  step and show that CRPO achieves an $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate to
  the global optimal policy in the constrained policy set and an $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$
  error bound on constraint satisfaction. This is the first finite-time analysis of
  primal SRL algorithms with global optimality guarantee. Our empirical results demonstrate
  that CRPO can outperform the existing primal-dual baseline algorithms significantly.
