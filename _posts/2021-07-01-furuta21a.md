title: 'Policy Information Capacity: Information-Theoretic Measure for Task Complexity
  in Deep Reinforcement Learning'
abstract: Progress in deep reinforcement learning (RL) research is largely enabled
  by benchmark task environments. However, analyzing the nature of those environments
  is often overlooked. In particular, we still do not have agreeable ways to measure
  the difficulty or solvability of a task, given that each has fundamentally different
  actions, observations, dynamics, rewards, and can be tackled with diverse RL algorithms.
  In this work, we propose policy information capacity (PIC) – the mutual information
  between policy parameters and episodic return – and policy-optimal information capacity
  (POIC) – between policy parameters and episodic optimality – as two environment-agnostic,
  algorithm-agnostic quantitative metrics for task difficulty. Evaluating our metrics
  across toy environments as well as continuous control benchmark tasks from OpenAI
  Gym and DeepMind Control Suite, we empirically demonstrate that these information-theoretic
  metrics have higher correlations with normalized task solvability scores than a
  variety of alternatives. Lastly, we show that these metrics can also be used for
  fast and compute-efficient optimizations of key design parameters such as reward
  shaping, policy architectures, and MDP properties for better solvability by RL algorithms
  without ever running full RL experiments.
