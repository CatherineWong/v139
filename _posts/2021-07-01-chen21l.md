title: 'Finding the Stochastic Shortest Path with Low Regret: the Adversarial Cost
  and Unknown Transition Case'
abstract: 'We make significant progress toward the stochastic shortest path problem
  with adversarial costs and unknown transition. Specifically, we develop algorithms
  that achieve $O(\sqrt{S^2ADT_\star K})$ regret for the full-information setting
  and $O(\sqrt{S^3A^2DT_\star K})$ regret for the bandit feedback setting, where $D$
  is the diameter, $T_\star$ is the expected hitting time of the optimal policy, $S$
  is the number of states, $A$ is the number of actions, and $K$ is the number of
  episodes. Our work strictly improves (Rosenberg and Mansour, 2020) in the full information
  setting, extends (Chen et al., 2020) from known transition to unknown transition,
  and is also the first to consider the most challenging combination: bandit feedback
  with adversarial costs and unknown transition. To remedy the gap between our upper
  bounds and the current best lower bounds constructed via a stochastically oblivious
  adversary, we also propose algorithms with near-optimal regret for this special
  case.'
