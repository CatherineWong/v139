title: 'Multi-layered Network Exploration via Random Walks: From Offline Optimization
  to Online Learning'
abstract: Multi-layered network exploration (MuLaNE) problem is an important problem
  abstracted from many applications. In MuLaNE, there are multiple network layers
  where each node has an importance weight and each layer is explored by a random
  walk. The MuLaNE task is to allocate total random walk budget $B$ into each network
  layer so that the total weights of the unique nodes visited by random walks are
  maximized. We systematically study this problem from offline optimization to online
  learning. For the offline optimization setting where the network structure and node
  weights are known, we provide greedy based constant-ratio approximation algorithms
  for overlapping networks, and greedy or dynamic-programming based optimal solutions
  for non-overlapping networks. For the online learning setting, neither the network
  structure nor the node weights are known initially. We adapt the combinatorial multi-armed
  bandit framework and design algorithms to learn random walk related parameters and
  node weights while optimizing the budget allocation in multiple rounds, and prove
  that they achieve logarithmic regret bounds. Finally, we conduct experiments on
  a real-world social network dataset to validate our theoretical results.
