title: Unbiased Gradient Estimation in Unrolled Computation Graphs with Persistent
  Evolution Strategies
abstract: Unrolled computation graphs arise in many scenarios, including training
  RNNs, tuning hyperparameters through unrolled optimization, and training learned
  optimizers. Current approaches to optimizing parameters in such computation graphs
  suffer from high variance gradients, bias, slow updates, or large memory usage.
  We introduce a method called Persistent Evolution Strategies (PES), which divides
  the computation graph into a series of truncated unrolls, and performs an evolution
  strategies-based update step after each unroll. PES eliminates bias from these truncations
  by accumulating correction terms over the entire sequence of unrolls. PES allows
  for rapid parameter updates, has low memory usage, is unbiased, and has reasonable
  variance characteristics. We experimentally demonstrate the advantages of PES compared
  to several other methods for gradient estimation on synthetic tasks, and show its
  applicability to training learned optimizers and tuning hyperparameters.
