title: 'KO codes: inventing nonlinear encoding and decoding for reliable wireless
  communication via deep-learning'
abstract: 'Landmark codes underpin reliable physical layer communication, e.g., Reed-Muller,
  BCH, Convolution, Turbo, LDPC, and Polar codes: each is a linear code and represents
  a mathematical breakthrough. The impact on humanity is huge: each of these codes
  has been used in global wireless communication standards (satellite, WiFi, cellular).
  Reliability of communication over the classical additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN)
  channel enables benchmarking and ranking of the different codes. In this paper,
  we construct KO codes, a computationally efficient family of deep-learning driven
  (encoder, decoder) pairs that outperform the state-of-the-art reliability performance
  on the standardized AWGN channel. KO codes beat state-of-the-art Reed-Muller and
  Polar codes, under the low-complexity successive cancellation decoding, in the challenging
  short-to-medium block length regime on the AWGN channel. We show that the gains
  of KO codes are primarily due to the nonlinear mapping of information bits directly
  to transmit symbols (bypassing modulation) and yet possess an efficient, high-performance
  decoder. The key technical innovation that renders this possible is design of a
  novel family of neural architectures inspired by the computation tree of the {\bf
  K}ronecker {\bf O}peration (KO) central to Reed-Muller and Polar codes. These architectures
  pave way for the discovery of a much richer class of hitherto unexplored nonlinear
  algebraic structures.'
