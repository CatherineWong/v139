title: ChaCha for Online AutoML
abstract: We propose the ChaCha (Champion-Challengers) algorithm for making an online
  choice of hyperparameters in online learning settings. ChaCha handles the process
  of determining a champion and scheduling a set of ‘live’ challengers over time based
  on sample complexity bounds. It is guaranteed to have sublinear regret after the
  optimal configuration is added into consideration by an application-dependent oracle
  based on the champions. Empirically, we show that ChaCha provides good performance
  across a wide array of datasets when optimizing over featurization and hyperparameter
  decisions.
