title: Average-Reward Off-Policy Policy Evaluation with Function Approximation
abstract: We consider off-policy policy evaluation with function approximation (FA)
  in average-reward MDPs, where the goal is to estimate both the reward rate and the
  differential value function. For this problem, bootstrapping is necessary and, along
  with off-policy learning and FA, results in the deadly triad (Sutton & Barto, 2018).
  To address the deadly triad, we propose two novel algorithms, reproducing the celebrated
  success of Gradient TD algorithms in the average-reward setting. In terms of estimating
  the differential value function, the algorithms are the first convergent off-policy
  linear function approximation algorithms. In terms of estimating the reward rate,
  the algorithms are the first convergent off-policy linear function approximation
  algorithms that do not require estimating the density ratio. We demonstrate empirically
  the advantage of the proposed algorithms, as well as their nonlinear variants, over
  a competitive density-ratio-based approach, in a simple domain as well as challenging
  robot simulation tasks.
