title: Decoupling Representation Learning from Reinforcement Learning
abstract: In an effort to overcome limitations of reward-driven feature learning in
  deep reinforcement learning (RL) from images, we propose decoupling representation
  learning from policy learning. To this end, we introduce a new unsupervised learning
  (UL) task, called Augmented Temporal Contrast (ATC), which trains a convolutional
  encoder to associate pairs of observations separated by a short time difference,
  under image augmentations and using a contrastive loss. In online RL experiments,
  we show that training the encoder exclusively using ATC matches or outperforms end-to-end
  RL in most environments. Additionally, we benchmark several leading UL algorithms
  by pre-training encoders on expert demonstrations and using them, with weights frozen,
  in RL agents; we find that agents using ATC-trained encoders outperform all others.
  We also train multi-task encoders on data from multiple environments and show generalization
  to different downstream RL tasks. Finally, we ablate components of ATC, and introduce
  a new data augmentation to enable replay of (compressed) latent images from pre-trained
  encoders when RL requires augmentation. Our experiments span visually diverse RL
  benchmarks in DeepMind Control, DeepMind Lab, and Atari, and our complete code is
  available at \url{https://github.com/astooke/rlpyt/tree/master/rlpyt/ul}.
