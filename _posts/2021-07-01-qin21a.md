title: Density Constrained Reinforcement Learning
abstract: We study constrained reinforcement learning (CRL) from a novel perspective
  by setting constraints directly on state density functions, rather than the value
  functions considered by previous works. State density has a clear physical and mathematical
  interpretation, and is able to express a wide variety of constraints such as resource
  limits and safety requirements. Density constraints can also avoid the time-consuming
  process of designing and tuning cost functions required by value function-based
  constraints to encode system specifications. We leverage the duality between density
  functions and Q functions to develop an effective algorithm to solve the density
  constrained RL problem optimally and the constrains are guaranteed to be satisfied.
  We prove that the proposed algorithm converges to a near-optimal solution with a
  bounded error even when the policy update is imperfect. We use a set of comprehensive
  experiments to demonstrate the advantages of our approach over state-of-the-art
  CRL methods, with a wide range of density constrained tasks as well as standard
  CRL benchmarks such as Safety-Gym.
