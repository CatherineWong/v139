title: 'Fold2Seq: A Joint Sequence(1D)-Fold(3D) Embedding-based Generative Model for
  Protein Design'
abstract: Designing novel protein sequences for a desired 3D topological fold is a
  fundamental yet non-trivial task in protein engineering. Challenges exist due to
  the complex sequence–fold relationship, as well as the difficulties to capture the
  diversity of the sequences (therefore structures and functions) within a fold. To
  overcome these challenges, we propose Fold2Seq, a novel transformer-based generative
  framework for designing protein sequences conditioned on a specific target fold.
  To model the complex sequence–structure relationship, Fold2Seq jointly learns a
  sequence embedding using a transformer and a fold embedding from the density of
  secondary structural elements in 3D voxels. On test sets with single, high-resolution
  and complete structure inputs for individual folds, our experiments demonstrate
  improved or comparable performance of Fold2Seq in terms of speed, coverage, and
  reliability for sequence design, when compared to existing state-of-the-art methods
  that include data-driven deep generative models and physics-based RosettaDesign.
  The unique advantages of fold-based Fold2Seq, in comparison to a structure-based
  deep model and RosettaDesign, become more evident on three additional real-world
  challenges originating from low-quality, incomplete, or ambiguous input structures.
