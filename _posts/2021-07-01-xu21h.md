title: Conformal prediction interval for dynamic time-series
abstract: We develop a method to construct distribution-free prediction intervals
  for dynamic time-series, called \Verb|EnbPI| that wraps around any bootstrap ensemble
  estimator to construct sequential prediction intervals. \Verb|EnbPI| is closely
  related to the conformal prediction (CP) framework but does not require data exchangeability.
  Theoretically, these intervals attain finite-sample, \textit{approximately valid}
  marginal coverage for broad classes of regression functions and time-series with
  strongly mixing stochastic errors. Computationally, \Verb|EnbPI| avoids overfitting
  and requires neither data-splitting nor training multiple ensemble estimators; it
  efficiently aggregates bootstrap estimators that have been trained. In general,
  \Verb|EnbPI| is easy to implement, scalable to producing arbitrarily many prediction
  intervals sequentially, and well-suited to a wide range of regression functions.
  We perform extensive real-data analyses to demonstrate its effectiveness.
