title: On the Random Conjugate Kernel and Neural Tangent Kernel
abstract: We investigate the distributions of Conjugate Kernel (CK) and Neural Tangent
  Kernel (NTK) for ReLU networks with random initialization. We derive the precise
  distributions and moments of the diagonal elements of these kernels. For a feedforward
  network, these values converge in law to a log-normal distribution when the network
  depth $d$ and width $n$ simultaneously tend to infinity and the variance of log
  diagonal elements is proportional to ${d}/{n}$. For the residual network, in the
  limit that number of branches $m$ increases to infinity and the width $n$ remains
  fixed, the diagonal elements of Conjugate Kernel converge in law to a log-normal
  distribution where the variance of log value is proportional to ${1}/{n}$, and the
  diagonal elements of NTK converge in law to a log-normal distributed variable times
  the conjugate kernel of one feedforward network. Our new theoretical analysis results
  suggest that residual network remains trainable in the limit of infinite branches
  and fixed network width. The numerical experiments are conducted and all results
  validate the soundness of our theoretical analysis.
