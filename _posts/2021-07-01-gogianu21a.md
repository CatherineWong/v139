title: 'Spectral Normalisation for Deep Reinforcement Learning: An Optimisation Perspective'
abstract: Most of the recent deep reinforcement learning advances take an RL-centric
  perspective and focus on refinements of the training objective. We diverge from
  this view and show we can recover the performance of these developments not by changing
  the objective, but by regularising the value-function estimator. Constraining the
  Lipschitz constant of a single layer using spectral normalisation is sufficient
  to elevate the performance of a Categorical-DQN agent to that of a more elaborated
  agent on the challenging Atari domain. We conduct ablation studies to disentangle
  the various effects normalisation has on the learning dynamics and show that is
  sufficient to modulate the parameter updates to recover most of the performance
  of spectral normalisation. These findings hint towards the need to also focus on
  the neural component and its learning dynamics to tackle the peculiarities of Deep
  Reinforcement Learning.
