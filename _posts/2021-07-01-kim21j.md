title: Unsupervised Skill Discovery with Bottleneck Option Learning
abstract: Having the ability to acquire inherent skills from environments without
  any external rewards or supervision like humans is an important problem. We propose
  a novel unsupervised skill discovery method named Information Bottleneck Option
  Learning (IBOL). On top of the linearization of environments that promotes more
  various and distant state transitions, IBOL enables the discovery of diverse skills.
  It provides the abstraction of the skills learned with the information bottleneck
  framework for the options with improved stability and encouraged disentanglement.
  We empirically demonstrate that IBOL outperforms multiple state-of-the-art unsupervised
  skill discovery methods on the information-theoretic evaluations and downstream
  tasks in MuJoCo environments, including Ant, HalfCheetah, Hopper and Dâ€™Kitty. Our
  code is available at https://vision.snu.ac.kr/projects/ibol.
