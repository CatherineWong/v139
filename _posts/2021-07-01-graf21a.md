title: Dissecting Supervised Contrastive Learning
abstract: Minimizing cross-entropy over the softmax scores of a linear map composed
  with a high-capacity encoder is arguably the most popular choice for training neural
  networks on supervised learning tasks. However, recent works show that one can directly
  optimize the encoder instead, to obtain equally (or even more) discriminative representations
  via a supervised variant of a contrastive objective. In this work, we address the
  question whether there are fundamental differences in the sought-for representation
  geometry in the output space of the encoder at minimal loss. Specifically, we prove,
  under mild assumptions, that both losses attain their minimum once the representations
  of each class collapse to the vertices of a regular simplex, inscribed in a hypersphere.
  We provide empirical evidence that this configuration is attained in practice and
  that reaching a close-to-optimal state typically indicates good generalization performance.
  Yet, the two losses show remarkably different optimization behavior. The number
  of iterations required to perfectly fit to data scales superlinearly with the amount
  of randomly flipped labels for the supervised contrastive loss. This is in contrast
  to the approximately linear scaling previously reported for networks trained with
  cross-entropy.
