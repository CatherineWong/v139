title: Detection of Signal in the Spiked Rectangular Models
abstract: We consider the problem of detecting signals in the rank-one signal-plus-noise
  data matrix models that generalize the spiked Wishart matrices. We show that the
  principal component analysis can be improved by pre-transforming the matrix entries
  if the noise is non-Gaussian. As an intermediate step, we prove a sharp phase transition
  of the largest eigenvalues of spiked rectangular matrices, which extends the Baik–Ben
  Arous–Péché (BBP) transition. We also propose a hypothesis test to detect the presence
  of signal with low computational complexity, based on the linear spectral statistics,
  which minimizes the sum of the Type-I and Type-II errors when the noise is Gaussian.
