title: 'AlphaNet: Improved Training of Supernets with Alpha-Divergence'
abstract: Weight-sharing neural architecture search (NAS) is an effective technique
  for automating efficient neural architecture design. Weight-sharing NAS builds a
  supernet that assembles all the architectures as its sub-networks and jointly trains
  the supernet with the sub-networks. The success of weight-sharing NAS heavily relies
  on distilling the knowledge of the supernet to the sub-networks. However, we find
  that the widely used distillation divergence, i.e., KL divergence, may lead to student
  sub-networks that over-estimate or under-estimate the uncertainty of the teacher
  supernet, leading to inferior performance of the sub-networks. In this work, we
  propose to improve the supernet training with a more generalized alpha-divergence.
  By adaptively selecting the alpha-divergence, we simultaneously prevent the over-estimation
  or under-estimation of the uncertainty of the teacher model. We apply the proposed
  alpha-divergence based supernets training to both slimmable neural networks and
  weight-sharing NAS, and demonstrate significant improvements. Specifically, our
  discovered model family, AlphaNet, outperforms prior-art models on a wide range
  of FLOPs regimes, including BigNAS, Once-for-All networks, and AttentiveNAS. We
  achieve ImageNet top-1 accuracy of 80.0% with only 444M FLOPs. Our code and pretrained
  models are available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/AlphaNet.
