title: Federated Learning of User Verification Models Without Sharing Embeddings
abstract: We consider the problem of training User Verification (UV) models in federated
  setup, where each user has access to the data of only one class and user embeddings
  cannot be shared with the server or other users. To address this problem, we propose
  Federated User Verification (FedUV), a framework in which users jointly learn a
  set of vectors and maximize the correlation of their instance embeddings with a
  secret linear combination of those vectors. We show that choosing the linear combinations
  from the codewords of an error-correcting code allows users to collaboratively train
  the model without revealing their embedding vectors. We present the experimental
  results for user verification with voice, face, and handwriting data and show that
  FedUV is on par with existing approaches, while not sharing the embeddings with
  other users or the server.
