title: What Are Bayesian Neural Network Posteriors Really Like?
abstract: The posterior over Bayesian neural network (BNN) parameters is extremely
  high-dimensional and non-convex. For computational reasons, researchers approximate
  this posterior using inexpensive mini-batch methods such as mean-field variational
  inference or stochastic-gradient Markov chain Monte Carlo (SGMCMC). To investigate
  foundational questions in Bayesian deep learning, we instead use full batch Hamiltonian
  Monte Carlo (HMC) on modern architectures. We show that (1) BNNs can achieve significant
  performance gains over standard training and deep ensembles; (2) a single long HMC
  chain can provide a comparable representation of the posterior to multiple shorter
  chains; (3) in contrast to recent studies, we find posterior tempering is not needed
  for near-optimal performance, with little evidence for a “cold posterior” effect,
  which we show is largely an artifact of data augmentation; (4) BMA performance is
  robust to the choice of prior scale, and relatively similar for diagonal Gaussian,
  mixture of Gaussian, and logistic priors; (5) Bayesian neural networks show surprisingly
  poor generalization under domain shift; (6) while cheaper alternatives such as deep
  ensembles and SGMCMC can provide good generalization, their predictive distributions
  are distinct from HMC. Notably, deep ensemble predictive distributions are similarly
  close to HMC as standard SGLD, and closer than standard variational inference.
