title: Provable Robustness of Adversarial Training for Learning Halfspaces with Noise
abstract: We analyze the properties of adversarial training for learning adversarially
  robust halfspaces in the presence of agnostic label noise. Denoting $\mathsf{OPT}_{p,r}$
  as the best classification error achieved by a halfspace that is robust to perturbations
  of $\ell^{p}$ balls of radius $r$, we show that adversarial training on the standard
  binary cross-entropy loss yields adversarially robust halfspaces up to classification
  error $\tilde O(\sqrt{\mathsf{OPT}_{2,r}})$ for $p=2$, and $\tilde O(d^{1/4} \sqrt{\mathsf{OPT}_{\infty,
  r}})$ when $p=\infty$. Our results hold for distributions satisfying anti-concentration
  properties enjoyed by log-concave isotropic distributions among others. We additionally
  show that if one instead uses a non-convex sigmoidal loss, adversarial training
  yields halfspaces with an improved robust classification error of $O(\mathsf{OPT}_{2,r})$
  for $p=2$, and $O(d^{1/4} \mathsf{OPT}_{\infty, r})$ when $p=\infty$. To the best
  of our knowledge, this is the first work showing that adversarial training provably
  yields robust classifiers in the presence of noise.
