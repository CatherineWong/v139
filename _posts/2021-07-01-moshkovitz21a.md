title: Connecting Interpretability and Robustness in Decision Trees through Separation
abstract: Recent research has recognized interpretability and robustness as essential
  properties of trustworthy classification. Curiously, a connection between robustness
  and interpretability was empirically observed, but the theoretical reasoning behind
  it remained elusive. In this paper, we rigorously investigate this connection. Specifically,
  we focus on interpretation using decision trees and robustness to l_{\infty}-perturbation.
  Previous works defined the notion of r-separation as a sufficient condition for
  robustness. We prove upper and lower bounds on the tree size in case the data is
  r-separated. We then show that a tighter bound on the size is possible when the
  data is linearly separated. We provide the first algorithm with provable guarantees
  both on robustness, interpretability, and accuracy in the context of decision trees.
  Experiments confirm that our algorithm yields classifiers that are both interpretable
  and robust and have high accuracy.
