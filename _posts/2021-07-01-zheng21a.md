title: Fused Acoustic and Text Encoding for Multimodal Bilingual Pretraining and Speech
  Translation
abstract: 'Recently, representation learning for text and speech has successfully
  improved many language related tasks. However, all existing methods suffer from
  two limitations: (a) they only learn from one input modality, while a unified representation
  for both speech and text is needed by tasks such as end-to-end speech translation,
  and as a result, (b) they can not exploit various large-scale text and speech data
  and their performance is limited by the scarcity of parallel speech translation
  data. To address these problems, we propose a Fused Acoustic and Text Masked Language
  Model (FAT-MLM) which jointly learns a unified representation for both acoustic
  and text input from various types of corpora including parallel data for speech
  recognition and machine translation, and even pure speech and text data. Within
  this cross-modal representation learning framework, we further present an end-to-end
  model for Fused Acoustic and Text Speech Translation (FAT-ST). Experiments on three
  translation directions show that by fine-tuning from FAT-MLM, our proposed speech
  translation models substantially improve translation quality by up to +5.9 BLEU.'
