title: Object Segmentation Without Labels with Large-Scale Generative Models
abstract: The recent rise of unsupervised and self-supervised learning has dramatically
  reduced the dependency on labeled data, providing high-quality representations for
  transfer on downstream tasks. Furthermore, recent works also employed these representations
  in a fully unsupervised setup for image classification, reducing the need for human
  labels on the fine-tuning stage as well. This work demonstrates that large-scale
  unsupervised models can also perform a more challenging object segmentation task,
  requiring neither pixel-level nor image-level labeling. Namely, we show that recent
  unsupervised GANs allow to differentiate between foreground/background pixels, providing
  high-quality saliency masks. By extensive comparison on common benchmarks, we outperform
  existing unsupervised alternatives for object segmentation, achieving new state-of-the-art.
