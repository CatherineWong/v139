title: 'GP-Tree: A Gaussian Process Classifier for Few-Shot Incremental Learning'
abstract: Gaussian processes (GPs) are non-parametric, flexible, models that work
  well in many tasks. Combining GPs with deep learning methods via deep kernel learning
  (DKL) is especially compelling due to the strong representational power induced
  by the network. However, inference in GPs, whether with or without DKL, can be computationally
  challenging on large datasets. Here, we propose GP-Tree, a novel method for multi-class
  classification with Gaussian processes and DKL. We develop a tree-based hierarchical
  model in which each internal node of the tree fits a GP to the data using the P{รณ}lya-Gamma
  augmentation scheme. As a result, our method scales well with both the number of
  classes and data size. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method against other
  Gaussian process training baselines, and we show how our general GP approach achieves
  improved accuracy on standard incremental few-shot learning benchmarks.
