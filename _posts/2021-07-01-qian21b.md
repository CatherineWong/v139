title: Global Prosody Style Transfer Without Text Transcriptions
abstract: Prosody plays an important role in characterizing the style of a speaker
  or an emotion, but most non-parallel voice or emotion style transfer algorithms
  do not convert any prosody information. Two major components of prosody are pitch
  and rhythm. Disentangling the prosody information, particularly the rhythm component,
  from the speech is challenging because it involves breaking the synchrony between
  the input speech and the disentangled speech representation. As a result, most existing
  prosody style transfer algorithms would need to rely on some form of text transcriptions
  to identify the content information, which confines their application to high-resource
  languages only. Recently, SpeechSplit has made sizeable progress towards unsupervised
  prosody style transfer, but it is unable to extract high-level global prosody style
  in an unsupervised manner. In this paper, we propose AutoPST, which can disentangle
  global prosody style from speech without relying on any text transcriptions. AutoPST
  is an Autoencoder-based Prosody Style Transfer framework with a thorough rhythm
  removal module guided by the self-expressive representation learning. Experiments
  on different style transfer tasks show that AutoPST can effectively convert prosody
  that correctly reflects the styles of the target domains.
