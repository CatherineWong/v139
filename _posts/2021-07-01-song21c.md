title: Fast Sketching of Polynomial Kernels of Polynomial Degree
abstract: Kernel methods are fundamental in machine learning, and faster algorithms
  for kernel approximation provide direct speedups for many core tasks in machine
  learning. The polynomial kernel is especially important as other kernels can often
  be approximated by the polynomial kernel via a Taylor series expansion. Recent techniques
  in oblivious sketching reduce the dependence in the running time on the degree $q$
  of the polynomial kernel from exponential to polynomial, which is useful for the
  Gaussian kernel, for which $q$ can be chosen to be polylogarithmic. However, for
  more slowly growing kernels, such as the neural tangent and arc cosine kernels,
  $q$ needs to be polynomial, and previous work incurs a polynomial factor slowdown
  in the running time. We give a new oblivious sketch which greatly improves upon
  this running time, by removing the dependence on $q$ in the leading order term.
  Combined with a novel sampling scheme, we give the fastest algorithms for approximating
  a large family of slow-growing kernels.
