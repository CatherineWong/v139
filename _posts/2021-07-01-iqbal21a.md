title: Randomized Entity-wise Factorization for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
abstract: 'Multi-agent settings in the real world often involve tasks with varying
  types and quantities of agents and non-agent entities; however, common patterns
  of behavior often emerge among these agents/entities. Our method aims to leverage
  these commonalities by asking the question: “What is the expected utility of each
  agent when only considering a randomly selected sub-group of its observed entities?”
  By posing this counterfactual question, we can recognize state-action trajectories
  within sub-groups of entities that we may have encountered in another task and use
  what we learned in that task to inform our prediction in the current one. We then
  reconstruct a prediction of the full returns as a combination of factors considering
  these disjoint groups of entities and train this “randomly factorized" value function
  as an auxiliary objective for value-based multi-agent reinforcement learning. By
  doing so, our model can recognize and leverage similarities across tasks to improve
  learning efficiency in a multi-task setting. Our approach, Randomized Entity-wise
  Factorization for Imagined Learning (REFIL), outperforms all strong baselines by
  a significant margin in challenging multi-task StarCraft micromanagement settings.'
