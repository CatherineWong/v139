title: 'CRFL: Certifiably Robust Federated Learning against Backdoor Attacks'
abstract: Federated Learning (FL) as a distributed learning paradigm that aggregates
  information from diverse clients to train a shared global model, has demonstrated
  great success. However, malicious clients can perform poisoning attacks and model
  replacement to introduce backdoors into the trained global model. Although there
  have been intensive studies designing robust aggregation methods and empirical robust
  federated training protocols against backdoors, existing approaches lack robustness
  certification. This paper provides the first general framework, Certifiably Robust
  Federated Learning (CRFL), to train certifiably robust FL models against backdoors.
  Our method exploits clipping and smoothing on model parameters to control the global
  model smoothness, which yields a sample-wise robustness certification on backdoors
  with limited magnitude. Our certification also specifies the relation to federated
  learning parameters, such as poisoning ratio on instance level, number of attackers,
  and training iterations. Practically, we conduct comprehensive experiments across
  a range of federated datasets, and provide the first benchmark for certified robustness
  against backdoor attacks in federated learning. Our code is publicaly available
  at https://github.com/AI-secure/CRFL.
