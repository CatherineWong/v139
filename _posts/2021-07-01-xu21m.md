title: 'KNAS: Green Neural Architecture Search'
abstract: 'Many existing neural architecture search (NAS) solutions rely on downstream
  training for architecture evaluation, which takes enormous computations. Considering
  that these computations bring a large carbon footprint, this paper aims to explore
  a green (namely environmental-friendly) NAS solution that evaluates architectures
  without training. Intuitively, gradients, induced by the architecture itself, directly
  decide the convergence and generalization results. It motivates us to propose the
  gradient kernel hypothesis: Gradients can be used as a coarse-grained proxy of downstream
  training to evaluate random-initialized networks. To support the hypothesis, we
  conduct a theoretical analysis and find a practical gradient kernel that has good
  correlations with training loss and validation performance. According to this hypothesis,
  we propose a new kernel based architecture search approach KNAS. Experiments show
  that KNAS achieves competitive results with orders of magnitude faster than “train-then-test”
  paradigms on image classification tasks. Furthermore, the extremely low search cost
  enables its wide applications. The searched network also outperforms strong baseline
  RoBERTA-large on two text classification tasks.'
