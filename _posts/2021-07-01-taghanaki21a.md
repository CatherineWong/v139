title: Robust Representation Learning via Perceptual Similarity Metrics
abstract: 'A fundamental challenge in artificial intelligence is learning useful representations
  of data that yield good performance on a downstream classification task, without
  overfitting to spurious input features. Extracting such task-relevant predictive
  information becomes particularly difficult for noisy and high-dimensional real-world
  data. In this work, we propose Contrastive Input Morphing (CIM), a representation
  learning framework that learns input-space transformations of the data to mitigate
  the effect of irrelevant input features on downstream performance. Our method leverages
  a perceptual similarity metric via a triplet loss to ensure that the transformation
  preserves task-relevant information. Empirically, we demonstrate the efficacy of
  our approach on various tasks which typically suffer from the presence of spurious
  correlations: classification with nuisance information, out-of-distribution generalization,
  and preservation of subgroup accuracies. We additionally show that CIM is complementary
  to other mutual information-based representation learning techniques, and demonstrate
  that it improves the performance of variational information bottleneck (VIB) when
  used in conjunction.'
