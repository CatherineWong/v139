title: 'Don’t Just Blame Over-parametrization for Over-confidence: Theoretical Analysis
  of Calibration in Binary Classification'
abstract: Modern machine learning models with high accuracy are often miscalibrated—the
  predicted top probability does not reflect the actual accuracy, and tends to be
  \emph{over-confident}. It is commonly believed that such over-confidence is mainly
  due to \emph{over-parametrization}, in particular when the model is large enough
  to memorize the training data and maximize the confidence. In this paper, we show
  theoretically that over-parametrization is not the only reason for over-confidence.
  We prove that \emph{logistic regression is inherently over-confident}, in the realizable,
  under-parametrized setting where the data is generated from the logistic model,
  and the sample size is much larger than the number of parameters. Further, this
  over-confidence happens for general well-specified binary classification problems
  as long as the activation is symmetric and concave on the positive part. Perhaps
  surprisingly, we also show that over-confidence is not always the case—there exists
  another activation function (and a suitable loss function) under which the learned
  classifier is \emph{under-confident} at some probability values. Overall, our theory
  provides a precise characterization of calibration in realizable binary classification,
  which we verify on simulations and real data experiments.
