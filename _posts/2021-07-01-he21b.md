title: 'SoundDet: Polyphonic Moving Sound Event Detection and Localization from Raw
  Waveform'
abstract: We present a new framework SoundDet, which is an end-to-end trainable and
  light-weight framework, for polyphonic moving sound event detection and localization.
  Prior methods typically approach this problem by preprocessing raw waveform into
  time-frequency representations, which is more amenable to process with well-established
  image processing pipelines. Prior methods also detect in segment-wise manner, leading
  to incomplete and partial detections. SoundDet takes a novel approach and directly
  consumes the raw, multichannel waveform and treats the spatio-temporal sound event
  as a complete “sound-object" to be detected. Specifically, SoundDet consists of
  a backbone neural network and two parallel heads for temporal detection and spatial
  localization, respectively. Given the large sampling rate of raw waveform, the backbone
  network first learns a set of phase-sensitive and frequency-selective bank of filters
  to explicitly retain direction-of-arrival information, whilst being highly computationally
  and parametrically efficient than standard 1D/2D convolution. A dense sound event
  proposal map is then constructed to handle the challenges of predicting events with
  large varying temporal duration. Accompanying the dense proposal map are a temporal
  overlapness map and a motion smoothness map that measure a proposal’s confidence
  to be an event from temporal detection accuracy and movement consistency perspective.
  Involving the two maps guarantees SoundDet to be trained in a spatio-temporally
  unified manner. Experimental results on the public DCASE dataset show the advantage
  of SoundDet on both segment-based evaluation and our newly proposed event-based
  evaluation system.
