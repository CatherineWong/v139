title: Globally-Robust Neural Networks
abstract: The threat of adversarial examples has motivated work on training certifiably
  robust neural networks to facilitate efficient verification of local robustness
  at inference time. We formalize a notion of global robustness, which captures the
  operational properties of on-line local robustness certification while yielding
  a natural learning objective for robust training. We show that widely-used architectures
  can be easily adapted to this objective by incorporating efficient global Lipschitz
  bounds into the network, yielding certifiably-robust models by construction that
  achieve state-of-the-art verifiable accuracy. Notably, this approach requires significantly
  less time and memory than recent certifiable training methods, and leads to negligible
  costs when certifying points on-line; for example, our evaluation shows that it
  is possible to train a large robust Tiny-Imagenet model in a matter of hours. Our
  models effectively leverage inexpensive global Lipschitz bounds for real-time certification,
  despite prior suggestions that tighter local bounds are needed for good performance;
  we posit this is possible because our models are specifically trained to achieve
  tighter global bounds. Namely, we prove that the maximum achievable verifiable accuracy
  for a given dataset is not improved by using a local bound.
