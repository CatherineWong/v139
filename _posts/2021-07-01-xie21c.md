title: Deep Reinforcement Learning amidst Continual Structured Non-Stationarity
abstract: As humans, our goals and our environment are persistently changing throughout
  our lifetime based on our experiences, actions, and internal and external drives.
  In contrast, typical reinforcement learning problem set-ups consider decision processes
  that are stationary across episodes. Can we develop reinforcement learning algorithms
  that can cope with the persistent change in the former, more realistic problem settings?
  While on-policy algorithms such as policy gradients in principle can be extended
  to non-stationary settings, the same cannot be said for more efficient off-policy
  algorithms that replay past experiences when learning. In this work, we formalize
  this problem setting, and draw upon ideas from the online learning and probabilistic
  inference literature to derive an off-policy RL algorithm that can reason about
  and tackle such lifelong non-stationarity. Our method leverages latent variable
  models to learn a representation of the environment from current and past experiences,
  and performs off-policy RL with this representation. We further introduce several
  simulation environments that exhibit lifelong non-stationarity, and empirically
  find that our approach substantially outperforms approaches that do not reason about
  environment shift.
