title: 'Sharf: Shape-conditioned Radiance Fields from a Single View'
abstract: We present a method for estimating neural scenes representations of objects
  given only a single image. The core of our method is the estimation of a geometric
  scaffold for the object and its use as a guide for the reconstruction of the underlying
  radiance field. Our formulation is based on a generative process that first maps
  a latent code to a voxelized shape, and then renders it to an image, with the object
  appearance being controlled by a second latent code. During inference, we optimize
  both the latent codes and the networks to fit a test image of a new object. The
  explicit disentanglement of shape and appearance allows our model to be fine-tuned
  given a single image. We can then render new views in a geometrically consistent
  manner and they represent faithfully the input object. Additionally, our method
  is able to generalize to images outside of the training domain (more realistic renderings
  and even real photographs). Finally, the inferred geometric scaffold is itself an
  accurate estimate of the objectâ€™s 3D shape. We demonstrate in several experiments
  the effectiveness of our approach in both synthetic and real images.
