title: Size-Invariant Graph Representations for Graph Classification Extrapolations
abstract: 'In general, graph representation learning methods assume that the train
  and test data come from the same distribution. In this work we consider an underexplored
  area of an otherwise rapidly developing field of graph representation learning:
  The task of out-of-distribution (OOD) graph classification, where train and test
  data have different distributions, with test data unavailable during training. Our
  work shows it is possible to use a causal model to learn approximately invariant
  representations that better extrapolate between train and test data. Finally, we
  conclude with synthetic and real-world dataset experiments showcasing the benefits
  of representations that are invariant to train/test distribution shifts.'
