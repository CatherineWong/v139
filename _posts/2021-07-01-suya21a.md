title: Model-Targeted Poisoning Attacks with Provable Convergence
abstract: In a poisoning attack, an adversary who controls a small fraction of the
  training data attempts to select that data, so a model is induced that misbehaves
  in a particular way. We consider poisoning attacks against convex machine learning
  models and propose an efficient poisoning attack designed to induce a model specified
  by the adversary. Unlike previous model-targeted poisoning attacks, our attack comes
  with provable convergence to any attainable target model. We also provide a lower
  bound on the minimum number of poisoning points needed to achieve a given target
  model. Our method uses online convex optimization and finds poisoning points incrementally.
  This provides more flexibility than previous attacks which require an a priori assumption
  about the number of poisoning points. Our attack is the first model-targeted poisoning
  attack that provides provable convergence for convex models. In our experiments,
  it either exceeds or matches state-of-the-art attacks in terms of attack success
  rate and distance to the target model.
