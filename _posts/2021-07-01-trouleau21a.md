title: Cumulants of Hawkes Processes are Robust to Observation Noise
abstract: Multivariate Hawkes processes (MHPs) are widely used in a variety of fields
  to model the occurrence of causally related discrete events in continuous time.
  Most state-of-the-art approaches address the problem of learning MHPs from perfect
  traces without noise. In practice, the process through which events are collected
  might introduce noise in the timestamps. In this work, we address the problem of
  learning the causal structure of MHPs when the observed timestamps of events are
  subject to random and unknown shifts, also known as random translations. We prove
  that the cumulants of MHPs are invariant to random translations, and therefore can
  be used to learn their underlying causal structure. Furthermore, we empirically
  characterize the effect of random translations on state-of-the-art learning methods.
  We show that maximum likelihood-based estimators are brittle, while cumulant-based
  estimators remain stable even in the presence of significant time shifts.
