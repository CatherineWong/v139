title: Binary Classification from Multiple Unlabeled Datasets via Surrogate Set Classification
abstract: To cope with high annotation costs, training a classifier only from weakly
  supervised data has attracted a great deal of attention these days. Among various
  approaches, strengthening supervision from completely unsupervised classification
  is a promising direction, which typically employs class priors as the only supervision
  and trains a binary classifier from unlabeled (U) datasets. While existing risk-consistent
  methods are theoretically grounded with high flexibility, they can learn only from
  two U sets. In this paper, we propose a new approach for binary classification from
  $m$ U-sets for $m\ge2$. Our key idea is to consider an auxiliary classification
  task called surrogate set classification (SSC), which is aimed at predicting from
  which U set each observed sample is drawn. SSC can be solved by a standard (multi-class)
  classification method, and we use the SSC solution to obtain the final binary classifier
  through a certain linear-fractional transformation. We built our method in a flexible
  and efficient end-to-end deep learning framework and prove it to be classifier-consistent.
  Through experiments, we demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over
  state-of-the-art methods.
