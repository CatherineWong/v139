title: What’s in the Box? Exploring the Inner Life of Neural Networks with Robust
  Rules
abstract: 'We propose a novel method for exploring how neurons within neural networks
  interact. In particular, we consider activation values of a network for given data,
  and propose to mine noise-robust rules of the form X {\rightarrow} Y , where X and
  Y are sets of neurons in different layers. We identify the best set of rules by
  the Minimum Description Length Principle as the rules that together are most descriptive
  of the activation data. To learn good rule sets in practice, we propose the unsupervised
  ExplaiNN algorithm. Extensive evaluation shows that the patterns it discovers give
  clear insight in how networks perceive the world: they identify shared, respectively
  class-specific traits, compositionality within the network, as well as locality
  in convolutional layers. Moreover, these patterns are not only easily interpretable,
  but also supercharge prototyping as they identify which groups of neurons to consider
  in unison.'
