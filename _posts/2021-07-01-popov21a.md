title: 'Grad-TTS: A Diffusion Probabilistic Model for Text-to-Speech'
abstract: Recently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models and generative score
  matching have shown high potential in modelling complex data distributions while
  stochastic calculus has provided a unified point of view on these techniques allowing
  for flexible inference schemes. In this paper we introduce Grad-TTS, a novel text-to-speech
  model with score-based decoder producing mel-spectrograms by gradually transforming
  noise predicted by encoder and aligned with text input by means of Monotonic Alignment
  Search. The framework of stochastic differential equations helps us to generalize
  conventional diffusion probabilistic models to the case of reconstructing data from
  noise with different parameters and allows to make this reconstruction flexible
  by explicitly controlling trade-off between sound quality and inference speed. Subjective
  human evaluation shows that Grad-TTS is competitive with state-of-the-art text-to-speech
  approaches in terms of Mean Opinion Score.
