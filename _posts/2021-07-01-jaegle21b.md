title: Imitation by Predicting Observations
abstract: Imitation learning enables agents to reuse and adapt the hard-won expertise
  of others, offering a solution to several key challenges in learning behavior. Although
  it is easy to observe behavior in the real-world, the underlying actions may not
  be accessible. We present a new method for imitation solely from observations that
  achieves comparable performance to experts on challenging continuous control tasks
  while also exhibiting robustness in the presence of observations unrelated to the
  task. Our method, which we call FORM (for "Future Observation Reward Model") is
  derived from an inverse RL objective and imitates using a model of expert behavior
  learned by generative modelling of the expertâ€™s observations, without needing ground
  truth actions. We show that FORM performs comparably to a strong baseline IRL method
  (GAIL) on the DeepMind Control Suite benchmark, while outperforming GAIL in the
  presence of task-irrelevant features.
