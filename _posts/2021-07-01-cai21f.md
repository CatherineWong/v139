title: On Lower Bounds for Standard and Robust Gaussian Process Bandit Optimization
abstract: In this paper, we consider algorithm independent lower bounds for the problem
  of black-box optimization of functions having a bounded norm is some Reproducing
  Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), which can be viewed as a non-Bayesian Gaussian process
  bandit problem. In the standard noisy setting, we provide a novel proof technique
  for deriving lower bounds on the regret, with benefits including simplicity, versatility,
  and an improved dependence on the error probability. In a robust setting in which
  the final point is perturbed by an adversary, we strengthen an existing lower bound
  that only holds for target success probabilities very close to one, by allowing
  for arbitrary target success probabilities in (0, 1). Furthermore, in a distinct
  robust setting in which every sampled point may be perturbed by a constrained adversary,
  we provide a novel lower bound for deterministic strategies, demonstrating an inevitable
  joint dependence of the cumulative regret on the corruption level and the time horizon,
  in contrast with existing lower bounds that only characterize the individual dependencies.
