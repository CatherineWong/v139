title: Efficient Differentiable Simulation of Articulated Bodies
abstract: We present a method for efficient differentiable simulation of articulated
  bodies. This enables integration of articulated body dynamics into deep learning
  frameworks, and gradient-based optimization of neural networks that operate on articulated
  bodies. We derive the gradients of the contact solver using spatial algebra and
  the adjoint method. Our approach is an order of magnitude faster than autodiff tools.
  By only saving the initial states throughout the simulation process, our method
  reduces memory requirements by two orders of magnitude. We demonstrate the utility
  of efficient differentiable dynamics for articulated bodies in a variety of applications.
  We show that reinforcement learning with articulated systems can be accelerated
  using gradients provided by our method. In applications to control and inverse problems,
  gradient-based optimization enabled by our work accelerates convergence by more
  than an order of magnitude.
