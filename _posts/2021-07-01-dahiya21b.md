title: Fixed-Parameter and Approximation Algorithms for PCA with Outliers
abstract: PCA with Outliers is the fundamental problem of identifying an underlying
  low-dimensional subspace in a data set corrupted with outliers. A large body of
  work is devoted to the information-theoretic aspects of this problem. However, from
  the computational perspective, its complexity is still not well-understood. We study
  this problem from the perspective of parameterized complexity by investigating how
  parameters like the dimension of the data, the subspace dimension, the number of
  outliers and their structure, and approximation error, influence the computational
  complexity of the problem. Our algorithmic methods are based on techniques of randomized
  linear algebra and algebraic geometry.
