title: 'Order Matters: Probabilistic Modeling of Node Sequence for Graph Generation'
abstract: A graph generative model defines a distribution over graphs. Typically,
  the model consists of a sequential process that creates and adds nodes and edges.
  Such sequential process defines an ordering of the nodes in the graph. The computation
  of the modelâ€™s likelihood requires to marginalize the node orderings; this makes
  maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) challenging due to the (factorial) number of
  possible permutations. In this work, we provide an expression for the likelihood
  of a graph generative model and show that its calculation is closely related to
  the problem of graph automorphism. In addition, we derive a variational inference
  (VI) algorithm for fitting a graph generative model that is based on the maximization
  of a variational bound of the log-likelihood. This allows the model to be trained
  with node orderings from the approximate posterior instead of ad-hoc orderings.
  Our experiments show that our log-likelihood bound is significantly tighter than
  the bound of previous schemes. The models fitted with the VI algorithm are able
  to generate high-quality graphs that match the structures of target graphs not seen
  during training.
