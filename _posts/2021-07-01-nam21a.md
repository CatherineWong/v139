title: 'GMAC: A Distributional Perspective on Actor-Critic Framework'
abstract: In this paper, we devise a distributional framework on actor-critic as a
  solution to distributional instability, action type restriction, and conflation
  between samples and statistics. We propose a new method that minimizes the Cram{Ã©}r
  distance with the multi-step Bellman target distribution generated from a novel
  Sample-Replacement algorithm denoted SR(\lambda), which learns the correct value
  distribution under multiple Bellman operations. Parameterizing a value distribution
  with Gaussian Mixture Model further improves the efficiency and the performance
  of the method, which we name GMAC. We empirically show that GMAC captures the correct
  representation of value distributions and improves the performance of a conventional
  actor-critic method with low computational cost, in both discrete and continuous
  action spaces using Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) and PyBullet environment.
