title: Active Deep Probabilistic Subsampling
abstract: Subsampling a signal of interest can reduce costly data transfer, battery
  drain, radiation exposure and acquisition time in a wide range of problems. The
  recently proposed Deep Probabilistic Subsampling (DPS) method effectively integrates
  subsampling in an end-to-end deep learning model, but learns a static pattern for
  all datapoints. We generalize DPS to a sequential method that actively picks the
  next sample based on the information acquired so far; dubbed Active-DPS (A-DPS).
  We validate that A-DPS improves over DPS for MNIST classification at high subsampling
  rates. Moreover, we demonstrate strong performance in active acquisition Magnetic
  Resonance Image (MRI) reconstruction, outperforming DPS and other deep learning
  methods.
