title: Putting the “Learning" into Learning-Augmented Algorithms for Frequency Estimation
abstract: In learning-augmented algorithms, algorithms are enhanced using information
  from a machine learning algorithm. In turn, this suggests that we should tailor
  our machine-learning approach for the target algorithm. We here consider this synergy
  in the context of the learned count-min sketch from (Hsu et al., 2019). Learning
  here is used to predict heavy hitters from a data stream, which are counted explicitly
  outside the sketch. We show that an approximately sufficient statistic for the performance
  of the underlying count-min sketch is given by the coverage of the predictor, or
  the normalized $L^1$ norm of keys that are filtered by the predictor to be explicitly
  counted. We show that machine learning models which are trained to optimize for
  coverage lead to large improvements in performance over prior approaches according
  to the average absolute frequency error. Our source code can be found at https://github.com/franklynwang/putting-the-learning-in-LAA.
