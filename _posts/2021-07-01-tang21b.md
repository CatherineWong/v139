title: Taylor Expansion of Discount Factors
abstract: In practical reinforcement learning (RL), the discount factor used for estimating
  value functions often differs from that used for defining the evaluation objective.
  In this work, we study the effect that this discrepancy of discount factors has
  during learning, and discover a family of objectives that interpolate value functions
  of two distinct discount factors. Our analysis suggests new ways for estimating
  value functions and performing policy optimization updates, which demonstrate empirical
  performance gains. This framework also leads to new insights on commonly-used deep
  RL heuristic modifications to policy optimization algorithms.
