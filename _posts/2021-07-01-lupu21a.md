title: Trajectory Diversity for Zero-Shot Coordination
abstract: We study the problem of zero-shot coordination (ZSC), where agents must
  independently produce strategies for a collaborative game that are compatible with
  novel partners not seen during training. Our first contribution is to consider the
  need for diversity in generating such agents. Because self-play (SP) agents control
  their own trajectory distribution during training, each policy typically only performs
  well on this exact distribution. As a result, they achieve low scores in ZSC, since
  playing with another agent is likely to put them in situations they have not encountered
  during training. To address this issue, we train a common best response (BR) to
  a population of agents, which we regulate to be diverse. To this end, we introduce
  \textit{Trajectory Diversity} (TrajeDi) â€“ a differentiable objective for generating
  diverse reinforcement learning policies. We derive TrajeDi as a generalization of
  the Jensen-Shannon divergence between policies and motivate it experimentally in
  two simple settings. We then focus on the collaborative card game Hanabi, demonstrating
  the scalability of our method and improving upon the cross-play scores of both independently
  trained SP agents and BRs to unregularized populations.
