title: Graph Mixture Density Networks
abstract: We introduce the Graph Mixture Density Networks, a new family of machine
  learning models that can fit multimodal output distributions conditioned on graphs
  of arbitrary topology. By combining ideas from mixture models and graph representation
  learning, we address a broader class of challenging conditional density estimation
  problems that rely on structured data. In this respect, we evaluate our method on
  a new benchmark application that leverages random graphs for stochastic epidemic
  simulations. We show a significant improvement in the likelihood of epidemic outcomes
  when taking into account both multimodality and structure. The empirical analysis
  is complemented by two real-world regression tasks showing the effectiveness of
  our approach in modeling the output prediction uncertainty. Graph Mixture Density
  Networks open appealing research opportunities in the study of structure-dependent
  phenomena that exhibit non-trivial conditional output distributions.
