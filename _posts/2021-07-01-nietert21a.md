title: 'Smooth $p$-Wasserstein Distance: Structure, Empirical Approximation, and Statistical
  Applications'
abstract: Discrepancy measures between probability distributions, often termed statistical
  distances, are ubiquitous in probability theory, statistics and machine learning.
  To combat the curse of dimensionality when estimating these distances from data,
  recent work has proposed smoothing out local irregularities in the measured distributions
  via convolution with a Gaussian kernel. Motivated by the scalability of this framework
  to high dimensions, we investigate the structural and statistical behavior of the
  Gaussian-smoothed $p$-Wasserstein distance $\mathsf{W}_p^{(\sigma)}$, for arbitrary
  $p\geq 1$. After establishing basic metric and topological properties of $\mathsf{W}_p^{(\sigma)}$,
  we explore the asymptotic statistical properties of $\mathsf{W}_p^{(\sigma)}(\hat{\mu}_n,\mu)$,
  where $\hat{\mu}_n$ is the empirical distribution of $n$ independent observations
  from $\mu$. We prove that $\mathsf{W}_p^{(\sigma)}$ enjoys a parametric empirical
  convergence rate of $n^{-1/2}$, which contrasts the $n^{-1/d}$ rate for unsmoothed
  $\Wp$ when $d \geq 3$. Our proof relies on controlling $\mathsf{W}_p^{(\sigma)}$
  by a $p$th-order smooth Sobolev distance $\mathsf{d}_p^{(\sigma)}$ and deriving
  the limit distribution of $\sqrt{n}\,\mathsf{d}_p^{(\sigma)}(\hat{\mu}_n,\mu)$ for
  all dimensions $d$. As applications, we provide asymptotic guarantees for two-sample
  testing and minimum distance estimation using $\mathsf{W}_p^{(\sigma)}$, with experiments
  for $p=2$ using a maximum mean discrepancy formulation of $\mathsf{d}_2^{(\sigma)}$.
