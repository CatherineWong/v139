title: Spectral vertex sparsifiers and pair-wise spanners over distributed graphs
abstract: Graph sparsification is a powerful tool to approximate an arbitrary graph
  and has been used in machine learning over graphs. As real-world networks are becoming
  very large and naturally distributed, distributed graph sparsification has drawn
  considerable attention. In this work, we design communication-efficient distributed
  algorithms for constructing spectral vertex sparsifiers, which closely preserve
  effective resistance distances on a subset of vertices of interest in the original
  graphs, under the well-established message passing communication model. We prove
  that the communication cost approximates the lower bound with only a small gap.
  We further provide algorithms for constructing pair-wise spanners which approximate
  the shortest distances between each pair of vertices in a target set, instead of
  all pairs, and incur communication costs that are much smaller than those of existing
  algorithms in the message passing model. Experiments are performed to validate the
  communication efficiency of the proposed algorithms under the guarantee that the
  constructed sparsifiers have a good approximation quality.
