title: Optimization Planning for 3D ConvNets
abstract: It is not trivial to optimally learn a 3D Convolutional Neural Networks
  (3D ConvNets) due to high complexity and various options of the training scheme.
  The most common hand-tuning process starts from learning 3D ConvNets using short
  video clips and then is followed by learning long-term temporal dependency using
  lengthy clips, while gradually decaying the learning rate from high to low as training
  progresses. The fact that such process comes along with several heuristic settings
  motivates the study to seek an optimal "path" to automate the entire training. In
  this paper, we decompose the path into a series of training "states" and specify
  the hyper-parameters, e.g., learning rate and the length of input clips, in each
  state. The estimation of the knee point on the performance-epoch curve triggers
  the transition from one state to another. We perform dynamic programming over all
  the candidate states to plan the optimal permutation of states, i.e., optimization
  path. Furthermore, we devise a new 3D ConvNets with a unique design of dual-head
  classifier to improve spatial and temporal discrimination. Extensive experiments
  on seven public video recognition benchmarks demonstrate the advantages of our proposal.
  With the optimization planning, our 3D ConvNets achieves superior results when comparing
  to the state-of-the-art recognition methods. More remarkably, we obtain the top-1
  accuracy of 80.5% and 82.7% on Kinetics-400 and Kinetics-600 datasets, respectively.
