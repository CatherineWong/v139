title: A Scalable Second Order Method for Ill-Conditioned Matrix Completion from Few
  Samples
abstract: We propose an iterative algorithm for low-rank matrix completion with that
  can be interpreted as an iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) algorithm,
  a saddle-escaping smoothing Newton method or a variable metric proximal gradient
  method applied to a non-convex rank surrogate. It combines the favorable data-efficiency
  of previous IRLS approaches with an improved scalability by several orders of magnitude.
  We establish the first local convergence guarantee from a minimal number of samples
  for that class of algorithms, showing that the method attains a local quadratic
  convergence rate. Furthermore, we show that the linear systems to be solved are
  well-conditioned even for very ill-conditioned ground truth matrices. We provide
  extensive experiments, indicating that unlike many state-of-the-art approaches,
  our method is able to complete very ill-conditioned matrices with a condition number
  of up to $10^{10}$ from few samples, while being competitive in its scalability.
