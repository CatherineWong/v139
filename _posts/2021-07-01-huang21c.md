title: 'FL-NTK: A Neural Tangent Kernel-based Framework for Federated Learning Analysis'
abstract: 'Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging learning scheme that allows different
  distributed clients to train deep neural networks together without data sharing.
  Neural networks have become popular due to their unprecedented success. To the best
  of our knowledge, the theoretical guarantees of FL concerning neural networks with
  explicit forms and multi-step updates are unexplored. Nevertheless, training analysis
  of neural networks in FL is non-trivial for two reasons: first, the objective loss
  function we are optimizing is non-smooth and non-convex, and second, we are even
  not updating in the gradient direction. Existing convergence results for gradient
  descent-based methods heavily rely on the fact that the gradient direction is used
  for updating. The current paper presents a new class of convergence analysis for
  FL, Federated Neural Tangent Kernel (FL-NTK), which corresponds to overparamterized
  ReLU neural networks trained by gradient descent in FL and is inspired by the analysis
  in Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK). Theoretically, FL-NTK converges to a global-optimal
  solution at a linear rate with properly tuned learning parameters. Furthermore,
  with proper distributional assumptions, FL-NTK can also achieve good generalization.
  The proposed theoretical analysis scheme can be generalized to more complex neural
  networks.'
