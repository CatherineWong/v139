title: 'PopSkipJump: Decision-Based Attack for Probabilistic Classifiers'
abstract: Most current classifiers are vulnerable to adversarial examples, small input
  perturbations that change the classification output. Many existing attack algorithms
  cover various settings, from white-box to black-box classifiers, but usually assume
  that the answers are deterministic and often fail when they are not. We therefore
  propose a new adversarial decision-based attack specifically designed for classifiers
  with probabilistic outputs. It is based on the HopSkipJump attack by Chen et al.
  (2019), a strong and query efficient decision-based attack originally designed for
  deterministic classifiers. Our P(robabilisticH)opSkipJump attack adapts its amount
  of queries to maintain HopSkipJumpâ€™s original output quality across various noise
  levels, while converging to its query efficiency as the noise level decreases. We
  test our attack on various noise models, including state-of-the-art off-the-shelf
  randomized defenses, and show that they offer almost no extra robustness to decision-based
  attacks. Code is available at https://github.com/cjsg/PopSkipJump.
