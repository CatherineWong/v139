title: Just How Toxic is Data Poisoning? A Unified Benchmark for Backdoor and Data
  Poisoning Attacks
abstract: Data poisoning and backdoor attacks manipulate training data in order to
  cause models to fail during inference. A recent survey of industry practitioners
  found that data poisoning is the number one concern among threats ranging from model
  stealing to adversarial attacks. However, it remains unclear exactly how dangerous
  poisoning methods are and which ones are more effective considering that these methods,
  even ones with identical objectives, have not been tested in consistent or realistic
  settings. We observe that data poisoning and backdoor attacks are highly sensitive
  to variations in the testing setup. Moreover, we find that existing methods may
  not generalize to realistic settings. While these existing works serve as valuable
  prototypes for data poisoning, we apply rigorous tests to determine the extent to
  which we should fear them. In order to promote fair comparison in future work, we
  develop standardized benchmarks for data poisoning and backdoor attacks.
