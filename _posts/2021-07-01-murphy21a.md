title: 'Implicit-PDF: Non-Parametric Representation of Probability Distributions on
  the Rotation Manifold'
abstract: In the deep learning era, the vast majority of methods to predict pose from
  a single image are trained to classify or regress to a single given ground truth
  pose per image. Such methods have two main shortcomings, i) they cannot represent
  uncertainty about the predictions, and ii) they cannot handle symmetric objects,
  where multiple (potentially infinite) poses may be correct. Only recently these
  shortcomings have been addressed, but current approaches as limited in that they
  cannot express the full rich space of distributions on the rotation manifold. To
  this end, we introduce a method to estimate arbitrary, non-parametric distributions
  on SO(3). Our key idea is to represent the distributions implicitly, with a neural
  network that estimates the probability density, given the input image and a candidate
  pose. At inference time, grid sampling or gradient ascent can be used to find the
  most likely pose, but it is also possible to evaluate the density at any pose, enabling
  reasoning about symmetries and uncertainty. This is the most general way of representing
  distributions on manifolds, and to demonstrate its expressive power we introduce
  a new dataset containing symmetric and nearly-symmetric objects. Our method also
  shows advantages on the popular object pose estimation benchmarks ModelNet10-SO(3)
  and T-LESS. Code, data, and visualizations may be found at implicit-pdf.github.io.
