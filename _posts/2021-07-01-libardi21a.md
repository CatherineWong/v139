title: Guided Exploration with Proximal Policy Optimization using a Single Demonstration
abstract: Solving sparse reward tasks through exploration is one of the major challenges
  in deep reinforcement learning, especially in three-dimensional, partially-observable
  environments. Critically, the algorithm proposed in this article is capable of using
  a single human demonstration to solve hard-exploration problems. We train an agent
  on a combination of demonstrations and own experience to solve problems with variable
  initial conditions and we integrate it with proximal policy optimization (PPO).
  The agent is also able to increase its performance and to tackle harder problems
  by replaying its own past trajectories prioritizing them based on the obtained reward
  and the maximum value of the trajectory. We finally compare variations of this algorithm
  to different imitation learning algorithms on a set of hard-exploration tasks in
  the Animal-AI Olympics environment. To the best of our knowledge, learning a task
  in a three-dimensional environment with comparable difficulty has never been considered
  before using only one human demonstration.
