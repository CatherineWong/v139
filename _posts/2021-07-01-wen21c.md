title: Toward Understanding the Feature Learning Process of Self-supervised Contrastive
  Learning
abstract: 'We formally study how contrastive learning learns the feature representations
  for neural networks by investigating its feature learning process. We consider the
  case where our data are comprised of two types of features: the sparse features
  which we want to learn from, and the dense features we want to get rid of. Theoretically,
  we prove that contrastive learning using ReLU networks provably learns the desired
  features if proper augmentations are adopted. We present an underlying principle
  called feature decoupling to explain the effects of augmentations, where we theoretically
  characterize how augmentations can reduce the correlations of dense features between
  positive samples while keeping the correlations of sparse features intact, thereby
  forcing the neural networks to learn from the self-supervision of sparse features.
  Empirically, we verified that the feature decoupling principle matches the underlying
  mechanism of contrastive learning in practice.'
