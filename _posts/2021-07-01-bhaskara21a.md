title: Additive Error Guarantees for Weighted Low Rank Approximation
abstract: Low-rank approximation is a classic tool in data analysis, where the goal
  is to approximate a matrix $A$ with a low-rank matrix $L$ so as to minimize the
  error $\norm{A - L}_F^2$. However in many applications, approximating some entries
  is more important than others, which leads to the weighted low rank approximation
  problem. However, the addition of weights makes the low-rank approximation problem
  intractable. Thus many works have obtained efficient algorithms under additional
  structural assumptions on the weight matrix (such as low rank, and appropriate block
  structure). We study a natural greedy algorithm for weighted low rank approximation
  and develop a simple condition under which it yields bi-criteria approximation up
  to a small additive factor in the error. The algorithm involves iteratively computing
  the top singular vector of an appropriately varying matrix, and is thus easy to
  implement at scale. Our methods also allow us to study the problem of low rank approximation
  under $\ell_p$ norm error.
