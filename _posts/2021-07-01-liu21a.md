title: 'Understanding Instance-Level Label Noise: Disparate Impacts and Treatments'
abstract: This paper aims to provide understandings for the effect of an over-parameterized
  model, e.g. a deep neural network, memorizing instance-dependent noisy labels. We
  first quantify the harms caused by memorizing noisy instances, and show the disparate
  impacts of noisy labels for sample instances with different representation frequencies.
  We then analyze how several popular solutions for learning with noisy labels mitigate
  this harm at the instance level. Our analysis reveals that existing approaches lead
  to disparate treatments when handling noisy instances. While higher-frequency instances
  often enjoy a high probability of an improvement by applying these solutions, lower-frequency
  instances do not. Our analysis reveals new understandings for when these approaches
  work, and provides theoretical justifications for previously reported empirical
  observations. This observation requires us to rethink the distribution of label
  noise across instances and calls for different treatments for instances in different
  regimes.
