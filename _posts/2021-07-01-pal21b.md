title: RNN with Particle Flow for Probabilistic Spatio-temporal Forecasting
abstract: Spatio-temporal forecasting has numerous applications in analyzing wireless,
  traffic, and financial networks. Many classical statistical models often fall short
  in handling the complexity and high non-linearity present in time-series data. Recent
  advances in deep learning allow for better modelling of spatial and temporal dependencies.
  While most of these models focus on obtaining accurate point forecasts, they do
  not characterize the prediction uncertainty. In this work, we consider the time-series
  data as a random realization from a nonlinear state-space model and target Bayesian
  inference of the hidden states for probabilistic forecasting. We use particle flow
  as the tool for approximating the posterior distribution of the states, as it is
  shown to be highly effective in complex, high-dimensional settings. Thorough experimentation
  on several real world time-series datasets demonstrates that our approach provides
  better characterization of uncertainty while maintaining comparable accuracy to
  the state-of-the-art point forecasting methods.
