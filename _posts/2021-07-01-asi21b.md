title: 'Private Stochastic Convex Optimization: Optimal Rates in L1 Geometry'
abstract: Stochastic convex optimization over an $\ell_1$-bounded domain is ubiquitous
  in machine learning applications such as LASSO but remains poorly understood when
  learning with differential privacy. We show that, up to logarithmic factors the
  optimal excess population loss of any $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differentially private
  optimizer is $\sqrt{\log(d)/n} + \sqrt{d}/\epsilon n.$ The upper bound is based
  on a new algorithm that combines the iterative localization approach of Feldman
  et al. (2020) with a new analysis of private regularized mirror descent. It applies
  to $\ell_p$ bounded domains for $p\in [1,2]$ and queries at most $n^{3/2}$ gradients
  improving over the best previously known algorithm for the $\ell_2$ case which needs
  $n^2$ gradients. Further, we show that when the loss functions satisfy additional
  smoothness assumptions, the excess loss is upper bounded (up to logarithmic factors)
  by $\sqrt{\log(d)/n} + (\log(d)/\epsilon n)^{2/3}.$ This bound is achieved by a
  new variance-reduced version of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm that requires just a single
  pass over the data. We also show that the lower bound in this case is the minimum
  of the two rates mentioned above.
