title: Supervised Tree-Wasserstein Distance
abstract: To measure the similarity of documents, the Wasserstein distance is a powerful
  tool, but it requires a high computational cost. Recently, for fast computation
  of the Wasserstein distance, methods for approximating the Wasserstein distance
  using a tree metric have been proposed. These tree-based methods allow fast comparisons
  of a large number of documents; however, they are unsupervised and do not learn
  task-specific distances. In this work, we propose the Supervised Tree-Wasserstein
  (STW) distance, a fast, supervised metric learning method based on the tree metric.
  Specifically, we rewrite the Wasserstein distance on the tree metric by the parent-child
  relationships of a tree, and formulate it as a continuous optimization problem using
  a contrastive loss. Experimentally, we show that the STW distance can be computed
  fast, and improves the accuracy of document classification tasks. Furthermore, the
  STW distance is formulated by matrix multiplications, runs on a GPU, and is suitable
  for batch processing. Therefore, we show that the STW distance is extremely efficient
  when comparing a large number of documents.
