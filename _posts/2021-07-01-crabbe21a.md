title: Explaining Time Series Predictions with Dynamic Masks
abstract: How can we explain the predictions of a machine learning model? When the
  data is structured as a multivariate time series, this question induces additional
  difficulties such as the necessity for the explanation to embody the time dependency
  and the large number of inputs. To address these challenges, we propose dynamic
  masks (Dynamask). This method produces instance-wise importance scores for each
  feature at each time step by fitting a perturbation mask to the input sequence.
  In order to incorporate the time dependency of the data, Dynamask studies the effects
  of dynamic perturbation operators. In order to tackle the large number of inputs,
  we propose a scheme to make the feature selection parsimonious (to select no more
  feature than necessary) and legible (a notion that we detail by making a parallel
  with information theory). With synthetic and real-world data, we demonstrate that
  the dynamic underpinning of Dynamask, together with its parsimony, offer a neat
  improvement in the identification of feature importance over time. The modularity
  of Dynamask makes it ideal as a plug-in to increase the transparency of a wide range
  of machine learning models in areas such as medicine and finance, where time series
  are abundant.
