title: Private Adaptive Gradient Methods for Convex Optimization
abstract: We study adaptive methods for differentially private convex optimization,
  proposing and analyzing differentially private variants of a Stochastic Gradient
  Descent (SGD) algorithm with adaptive stepsizes, as well as the AdaGrad algorithm.
  We provide upper bounds on the regret of both algorithms and show that the bounds
  are (worst-case) optimal. As a consequence of our development, we show that our
  private versions of AdaGrad outperform adaptive SGD, which in turn outperforms traditional
  SGD in scenarios with non-isotropic gradients where (non-private) Adagrad provably
  outperforms SGD. The major challenge is that the isotropic noise typically added
  for privacy dominates the signal in gradient geometry for high-dimensional problems;
  approaches to this that effectively optimize over lower-dimensional subspaces simply
  ignore the actual problems that varying gradient geometries introduce. In contrast,
  we study non-isotropic clipping and noise addition, developing a principled theoretical
  approach; the consequent procedures also enjoy significantly stronger empirical
  performance than prior approaches.
