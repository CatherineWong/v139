title: In-Database Regression in Input Sparsity Time
abstract: Sketching is a powerful dimensionality reduction technique for accelerating
  algorithms for data analysis. A crucial step in sketching methods is to compute
  a subspace embedding (SE) for a large matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times d}$. SE’s
  are the primary tool for obtaining extremely efficient solutions for many linear-algebraic
  tasks, such as least squares regression and low rank approximation. Computing an
  SE often requires an explicit representation of $A$ and running time proportional
  to the size of $A$. However, if $A= T_1 \Join T_2 \Join …\Join T_m$ is the result
  of a database join query on several smaller tables $T_i \in \mathbb{R}^{n_i \times
  d_i}$, then this running time can be prohibitive, as $A$ itself can have as many
  as $O(n_1 n_2 \cdots n_m)$ rows. In this work, we design subspace embeddings for
  database joins which can be computed significantly faster than computing the join.
  For the case of a two table join $A = T_1 \Join T_2$ we give input-sparsity algorithms
  for computing subspace embeddings, with running time bounded by the number of non-zero
  entries in $T_1,T_2$. This results in input-sparsity time algorithms for high accuracy
  regression, significantly improving upon the running time of prior FAQ-based methods
  for regression. We extend our results to arbitrary joins for the ridge regression
  problem, also considerably improving the running time of prior methods. Empirically,
  we apply our method to real datasets and show that it is significantly faster than
  existing algorithms.
