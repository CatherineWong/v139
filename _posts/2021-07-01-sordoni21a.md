title: Decomposed Mutual Information Estimation for Contrastive Representation Learning
abstract: Recent contrastive representation learning methods rely on estimating mutual
  information (MI) between multiple views of an underlying context. E.g., we can derive
  multiple views of a given image by applying data augmentation, or we can split a
  sequence into views comprising the past and future of some step in the sequence.
  Contrastive lower bounds on MI are easy to optimize, but have a strong underestimation
  bias when estimating large amounts of MI. We propose decomposing the full MI estimation
  problem into a sum of smaller estimation problems by splitting one of the views
  into progressively more informed subviews and by applying the chain rule on MI between
  the decomposed views. This expression contains a sum of unconditional and conditional
  MI terms, each measuring modest chunks of the total MI, which facilitates approximation
  via contrastive bounds. To maximize the sum, we formulate a contrastive lower bound
  on the conditional MI which can be approximated efficiently. We refer to our general
  approach as Decomposed Estimation of Mutual Information (DEMI). We show that DEMI
  can capture a larger amount of MI than standard non-decomposed contrastive bounds
  in a synthetic setting, and learns better representations in a vision domain and
  for dialogue generation.
