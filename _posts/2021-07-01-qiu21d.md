title: 'On Reward-Free RL with Kernel and Neural Function Approximations: Single-Agent
  MDP and Markov Game'
abstract: To achieve sample efficiency in reinforcement learning (RL), it necessitates
  to efficiently explore the underlying environment. Under the offline setting, addressing
  the exploration challenge lies in collecting an offline dataset with sufficient
  coverage. Motivated by such a challenge, we study the reward-free RL problem, where
  an agent aims to thoroughly explore the environment without any pre-specified reward
  function. Then, given any extrinsic reward, the agent computes the optimal policy
  via offline RL with data collected in the exploration stage. Moreover, we tackle
  this problem under the context of function approximation, leveraging powerful function
  approximators. Specifically, we propose to explore via an optimistic variant of
  the value-iteration algorithm incorporating kernel and neural function approximations,
  where we adopt the associated exploration bonus as the exploration reward. Moreover,
  we design exploration and planning algorithms for both single-agent MDPs and zero-sum
  Markov games and prove that our methods can achieve $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(1 /\varepsilon^2)$
  sample complexity for generating a $\varepsilon$-suboptimal policy or $\varepsilon$-approximate
  Nash equilibrium when given an arbitrary extrinsic reward. To the best of our knowledge,
  we establish the first provably efficient reward-free RL algorithm with kernel and
  neural function approximators.
