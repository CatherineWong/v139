title: Detecting Rewards Deterioration in Episodic Reinforcement Learning
abstract: In many RL applications, once training ends, it is vital to detect any deterioration
  in the agent performance as soon as possible. Furthermore, it often has to be done
  without modifying the policy and under minimal assumptions regarding the environment.
  In this paper, we address this problem by focusing directly on the rewards and testing
  for degradation. We consider an episodic framework, where the rewards within each
  episode are not independent, nor identically-distributed, nor Markov. We present
  this problem as a multivariate mean-shift detection problem with possibly partial
  observations. We define the mean-shift in a way corresponding to deterioration of
  a temporal signal (such as the rewards), and derive a test for this problem with
  optimal statistical power. Empirically, on deteriorated rewards in control problems
  (generated using various environment modifications), the test is demonstrated to
  be more powerful than standard tests - often by orders of magnitude. We also suggest
  a novel Bootstrap mechanism for False Alarm Rate control (BFAR), applicable to episodic
  (non-i.i.d) signal and allowing our test to run sequentially in an online manner.
  Our method does not rely on a learned model of the environment, is entirely external
  to the agent, and in fact can be applied to detect changes or drifts in any episodic
  signal.
