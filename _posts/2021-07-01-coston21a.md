title: Characterizing Fairness Over the Set of Good Models Under Selective Labels
abstract: Algorithmic risk assessments are used to inform decisions in a wide variety
  of high-stakes settings. Often multiple predictive models deliver similar overall
  performance but differ markedly in their predictions for individual cases, an empirical
  phenomenon known as the “Rashomon Effect.” These models may have different properties
  over various groups, and therefore have different predictive fairness properties.
  We develop a framework for characterizing predictive fairness properties over the
  set of models that deliver similar overall performance, or “the set of good models.”
  Our framework addresses the empirically relevant challenge of selectively labelled
  data in the setting where the selection decision and outcome are unconfounded given
  the observed data features. Our framework can be used to 1) audit for predictive
  bias; or 2) replace an existing model with one that has better fairness properties.
  We illustrate these use cases on a recidivism prediction task and a real-world credit-scoring
  task.
