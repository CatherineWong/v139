title: 'MARINA: Faster Non-Convex Distributed Learning with Compression'
abstract: 'We develop and analyze MARINA: a new communication efficient method for
  non-convex distributed learning over heterogeneous datasets. MARINA employs a novel
  communication compression strategy based on the compression of gradient differences
  that is reminiscent of but different from the strategy employed in the DIANA method
  of Mishchenko et al. (2019). Unlike virtually all competing distributed first-order
  methods, including DIANA, ours is based on a carefully designed biased gradient
  estimator, which is the key to its superior theoretical and practical performance.
  The communication complexity bounds we prove for MARINA are evidently better than
  those of all previous first-order methods. Further, we develop and analyze two variants
  of MARINA: VR-MARINA and PP-MARINA. The first method is designed for the case when
  the local loss functions owned by clients are either of a finite sum or of an expectation
  form, and the second method allows for a partial participation of clients {–} a
  feature important in federated learning. All our methods are superior to previous
  state-of-the-art methods in terms of oracle/communication complexity. Finally, we
  provide a convergence analysis of all methods for problems satisfying the Polyak-{Ł}ojasiewicz
  condition.'
