title: 'When All We Need is a Piece of the Pie: A Generic Framework for Optimizing
  Two-way Partial AUC'
abstract: 'The Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) is a crucial metric for machine learning,
  which evaluates the average performance over all possible True Positive Rates (TPRs)
  and False Positive Rates (FPRs). Based on the knowledge that a skillful classifier
  should simultaneously embrace a high TPR and a low FPR, we turn to study a more
  general variant called Two-way Partial AUC (TPAUC), where only the region with $\mathsf{TPR}
  \ge \alpha, \mathsf{FPR} \le \beta$ is included in the area. Moreover, a recent
  work shows that the TPAUC is essentially inconsistent with the existing Partial
  AUC metrics where only the FPR range is restricted, opening a new problem to seek
  solutions to leverage high TPAUC. Motivated by this, we present the first trial
  in this paper to optimize this new metric. The critical challenge along this course
  lies in the difficulty of performing gradient-based optimization with end-to-end
  stochastic training, even with a proper choice of surrogate loss. To address this
  issue, we propose a generic framework to construct surrogate optimization problems,
  which supports efficient end-to-end training with deep-learning. Moreover, our theoretical
  analyses show that: 1) the objective function of the surrogate problems will achieve
  an upper bound of the original problem under mild conditions, and 2) optimizing
  the surrogate problems leads to good generalization performance in terms of TPAUC
  with a high probability. Finally, empirical studies over several benchmark datasets
  speak to the efficacy of our framework.'
