title: Conjugate Energy-Based Models
abstract: In this paper, we propose conjugate energy-based models (CEBMs), a new class
  of energy-based models that define a joint density over data and latent variables.
  The joint density of a CEBM decomposes into an intractable distribution over data
  and a tractable posterior over latent variables. CEBMs have similar use cases as
  variational autoencoders, in the sense that they learn an unsupervised mapping from
  data to latent variables. However, these models omit a generator network, which
  allows them to learn more flexible notions of similarity between data points. Our
  experiments demonstrate that conjugate EBMs achieve competitive results in terms
  of image modelling, predictive power of latent space, and out-of-domain detection
  on a variety of datasets.
