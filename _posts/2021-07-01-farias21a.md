title: Near-Optimal Entrywise Anomaly Detection for Low-Rank Matrices with Sub-Exponential
  Noise
abstract: We study the problem of identifying anomalies in a low-rank matrix observed
  with sub-exponential noise, motivated by applications in retail and inventory management.
  State of the art approaches to anomaly detection in low-rank matrices apparently
  fall short, since they require that non-anomalous entries be observed with vanishingly
  small noise (which is not the case in our problem, and indeed in many applications).
  So motivated, we propose a conceptually simple entrywise approach to anomaly detection
  in low-rank matrices. Our approach accommodates a general class of probabilistic
  anomaly models. We extend recent work on entrywise error guarantees for matrix completion,
  establishing such guarantees for sub-exponential matrices, where in addition to
  missing entries, a fraction of entries are corrupted by (an also unknown) anomaly
  model. Viewing the anomaly detection as a classification task, to the best of our
  knowledge, we are the first to achieve the min-max optimal detection rate (up to
  log factors). Using data from a massive consumer goods retailer, we show that our
  approach provides significant improvements over incumbent approaches to anomaly
  detection.
