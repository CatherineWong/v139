title: Parallel Droplet Control in MEDA Biochips using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
abstract: 'Microfluidic biochips are being utilized for clinical diagnostics, including
  COVID-19 testing, because of they provide sample-to-result turnaround at low cost.
  Recently, microelectrode-dot-array (MEDA) biochips have been proposed to advance
  microfluidics technology. A MEDA biochip manipulates droplets of nano/picoliter
  volumes to automatically execute biochemical protocols. During bioassay execution,
  droplets are transported in parallel to achieve high-throughput outcomes. However,
  a major concern associated with the use of MEDA biochips is microelectrode degradation
  over time. Recent work has shown that formulating droplet transportation as a reinforcement-learning
  (RL) problem enables the training of policies to capture the underlying health conditions
  of microelectrodes and ensure reliable fluidic operations. However, the above RL-based
  approach suffers from two key limitations: 1) it cannot be used for concurrent transportation
  of multiple droplets; 2) it requires the availability of CCD cameras for monitoring
  droplet movement. To overcome these problems, we present a multi-agent reinforcement
  learning (MARL) droplet-routing solution that can be used for various sizes of MEDA
  biochips with integrated sensors, and we demonstrate the reliable execution of a
  serial-dilution bioassay with the MARL droplet router on a fabricated MEDA biochip.
  To facilitate further research, we also present a simulation environment based on
  the PettingZoo Gym Interface for MARL-guided droplet-routing problems on MEDA biochips.'
