title: Stabilizing Equilibrium Models by Jacobian Regularization
abstract: Deep equilibrium networks (DEQs) are a new class of models that eschews
  traditional depth in favor of finding the fixed point of a single non-linear layer.
  These models have been shown to achieve performance competitive with the state-of-the-art
  deep networks while using significantly less memory. Yet they are also slower, brittle
  to architectural choices, and introduce potential instability to the model. In this
  paper, we propose a regularization scheme for DEQ models that explicitly regularizes
  the Jacobian of the fixed-point update equations to stabilize the learning of equilibrium
  models. We show that this regularization adds only minimal computational cost, significantly
  stabilizes the fixed-point convergence in both forward and backward passes, and
  scales well to high-dimensional, realistic domains (e.g., WikiText-103 language
  modeling and ImageNet classification). Using this method, we demonstrate, for the
  first time, an implicit-depth model that runs with approximately the same speed
  and level of performance as popular conventional deep networks such as ResNet-101,
  while still maintaining the constant memory footprint and architectural simplicity
  of DEQs. Code is available https://github.com/locuslab/deq.
