title: 'DFAC Framework: Factorizing the Value Function via Quantile Mixture for Multi-Agent
  Distributional Q-Learning'
abstract: In fully cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) settings,
  the environments are highly stochastic due to the partial observability of each
  agent and the continuously changing policies of the other agents. To address the
  above issues, we integrate distributional RL and value function factorization methods
  by proposing a Distributional Value Function Factorization (DFAC) framework to generalize
  expected value function factorization methods to their distributional variants.
  DFAC extends the individual utility functions from deterministic variables to random
  variables, and models the quantile function of the total return as a quantile mixture.
  To validate DFAC, we demonstrate DFACâ€™s ability to factorize a simple two-step matrix
  game with stochastic rewards and perform experiments on all Super Hard tasks of
  StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge, showing that DFAC is able to outperform expected
  value function factorization baselines.
