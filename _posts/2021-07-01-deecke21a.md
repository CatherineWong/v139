title: Transfer-Based Semantic Anomaly Detection
abstract: Detecting semantic anomalies is challenging due to the countless ways in
  which they may appear in real-world data. While enhancing the robustness of networks
  may be sufficient for modeling simplistic anomalies, there is no good known way
  of preparing models for all potential and unseen anomalies that can potentially
  occur, such as the appearance of new object classes. In this paper, we show that
  a previously overlooked strategy for anomaly detection (AD) is to introduce an explicit
  inductive bias toward representations transferred over from some large and varied
  semantic task. We rigorously verify our hypothesis in controlled trials that utilize
  intervention, and show that it gives rise to surprisingly effective auxiliary objectives
  that outperform previous AD paradigms.
