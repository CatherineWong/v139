title: Exponentially Many Local Minima in Quantum Neural Networks
abstract: Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs), or the so-called variational quantum circuits,
  are important quantum applications both because of their similar promises as classical
  neural networks and because of the feasibility of their implementation on near-term
  intermediate-size noisy quantum machines (NISQ). However, the training task of QNNs
  is challenging and much less understood. We conduct a quantitative investigation
  on the landscape of loss functions of QNNs and identify a class of simple yet extremely
  hard QNN instances for training. Specifically, we show for typical under-parameterized
  QNNs, there exists a dataset that induces a loss function with the number of spurious
  local minima depending exponentially on the number of parameters. Moreover, we show
  the optimality of our construction by providing an almost matching upper bound on
  such dependence. While local minima in classical neural networks are due to non-linear
  activations, in quantum neural networks local minima appear as a result of the quantum
  interference phenomenon. Finally, we empirically confirm that our constructions
  can indeed be hard instances in practice with typical gradient-based optimizers,
  which demonstrates the practical value of our findings.
