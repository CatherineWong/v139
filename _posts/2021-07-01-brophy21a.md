title: Machine Unlearning for Random Forests
abstract: Responding to user data deletion requests, removing noisy examples, or deleting
  corrupted training data are just a few reasons for wanting to delete instances from
  a machine learning (ML) model. However, efficiently removing this data from an ML
  model is generally difficult. In this paper, we introduce data removal-enabled (DaRE)
  forests, a variant of random forests that enables the removal of training data with
  minimal retraining. Model updates for each DaRE tree in the forest are exact, meaning
  that removing instances from a DaRE model yields exactly the same model as retraining
  from scratch on updated data. DaRE trees use randomness and caching to make data
  deletion efficient. The upper levels of DaRE trees use random nodes, which choose
  split attributes and thresholds uniformly at random. These nodes rarely require
  updates because they only minimally depend on the data. At the lower levels, splits
  are chosen to greedily optimize a split criterion such as Gini index or mutual information.
  DaRE trees cache statistics at each node and training data at each leaf, so that
  only the necessary subtrees are updated as data is removed. For numerical attributes,
  greedy nodes optimize over a random subset of thresholds, so that they can maintain
  statistics while approximating the optimal threshold. By adjusting the number of
  thresholds considered for greedy nodes, and the number of random nodes, DaRE trees
  can trade off between more accurate predictions and more efficient updates. In experiments
  on 13 real-world datasets and one synthetic dataset, we find DaRE forests delete
  data orders of magnitude faster than retraining from scratch while sacrificing little
  to no predictive power.
