title: Sawtooth Factorial Topic Embeddings Guided Gamma Belief Network
abstract: Hierarchical topic models such as the gamma belief network (GBN) have delivered
  promising results in mining multi-layer document representations and discovering
  interpretable topic taxonomies. However, they often assume in the prior that the
  topics at each layer are independently drawn from the Dirichlet distribution, ignoring
  the dependencies between the topics both at the same layer and across different
  layers. To relax this assumption, we propose sawtooth factorial topic embedding
  guided GBN, a deep generative model of documents that captures the dependencies
  and semantic similarities between the topics in the embedding space. Specifically,
  both the words and topics are represented as embedding vectors of the same dimension.
  The topic matrix at a layer is factorized into the product of a factor loading matrix
  and a topic embedding matrix, the transpose of which is set as the factor loading
  matrix of the layer above. Repeating this particular type of factorization, which
  shares components between adjacent layers, leads to a structure referred to as sawtooth
  factorization. An auto-encoding variational inference network is constructed to
  optimize the model parameter via stochastic gradient descent. Experiments on big
  corpora show that our models outperform other neural topic models on extracting
  deeper interpretable topics and deriving better document representations.
