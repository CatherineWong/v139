title: Learning Task Informed Abstractions
abstract: 'Current model-based reinforcement learning methods struggle when operating
  from complex visual scenes due to their inability to prioritize task-relevant features.
  To mitigate this problem, we propose learning Task Informed Abstractions (TIA) that
  explicitly separates reward-correlated visual features from distractors. For learning
  TIA, we introduce the formalism of Task Informed MDP (TiMDP) that is realized by
  training two models that learn visual features via cooperative reconstruction, but
  one model is adversarially dissociated from the reward signal. Empirical evaluation
  shows that TIA leads to significant performance gains over state-of-the-art methods
  on many visual control tasks where natural and unconstrained visual distractions
  pose a formidable challenge. Project page: https://xiangfu.co/tia'
