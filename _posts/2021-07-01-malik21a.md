title: Inverse Constrained Reinforcement Learning
abstract: 'In real world settings, numerous constraints are present which are hard
  to specify mathematically. However, for the real world deployment of reinforcement
  learning (RL), it is critical that RL agents are aware of these constraints, so
  that they can act safely. In this work, we consider the problem of learning constraints
  from demonstrations of a constraint-abiding agent’s behavior. We experimentally
  validate our approach and show that our framework can successfully learn the most
  likely constraints that the agent respects. We further show that these learned constraints
  are \textit{transferable} to new agents that may have different morphologies and/or
  reward functions. Previous works in this regard have either mainly been restricted
  to tabular (discrete) settings, specific types of constraints or assume the environment’s
  transition dynamics. In contrast, our framework is able to learn arbitrary \textit{Markovian}
  constraints in high-dimensions in a completely model-free setting. The code is available
  at: \url{https://github.com/shehryar-malik/icrl}.'
