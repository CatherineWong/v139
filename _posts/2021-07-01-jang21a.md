title: Improved Regret Bounds of Bilinear Bandits using Action Space Analysis
abstract: We consider the bilinear bandit problem where the learner chooses a pair
  of arms, each from two different action spaces of dimension $d_1$ and $d_2$, respectively.
  The learner then receives a reward whose expectation is a bilinear function of the
  two chosen arms with an unknown matrix parameter $\Theta^*\in\mathbb{R}^{d_1 \times
  d_2}$ with rank $r$. Despite abundant applications such as drug discovery, the optimal
  regret rate is unknown for this problem, though it was conjectured to be $\tilde
  O(\sqrt{d_1d_2(d_1+d_2)r T})$ by Jun et al. (2019) where $\tilde O$ ignores polylogarithmic
  factors in $T$. In this paper, we make progress towards closing the gap between
  the upper and lower bound on the optimal regret. First, we reject the conjecture
  above by proposing algorithms that achieve the regret $\tilde O(\sqrt{d_1 d_2 (d_1+d_2)
  T})$ using the fact that the action space dimension $O(d_1+d_2)$ is significantly
  lower than the matrix parameter dimension $O(d_1 d_2)$. Second, we additionally
  devise an algorithm with better empirical performance than previous algorithms.
