title: Learning Optimal Auctions with Correlated Valuations from Samples
abstract: In single-item auction design, it is well known due to Cremer and McLean
  that when biddersâ€™ valuations are drawn from a correlated prior distribution, the
  auctioneer can extract full social surplus as revenue. However, in most real-world
  applications, the prior is usually unknown and can only be learned from historical
  data. In this work, we investigate the robustness of the optimal auction with correlated
  valuations via sample complexity analysis. We prove upper and lower bounds on the
  number of samples from the unknown prior required to learn a (1-epsilon)-approximately
  optimal auction. Our results reinforce the common belief that optimal correlated
  auctions are sensitive to the distribution parameters and hard to learn unless the
  prior distribution is well-behaved.
