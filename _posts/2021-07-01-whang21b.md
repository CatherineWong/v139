title: Composing Normalizing Flows for Inverse Problems
abstract: Given an inverse problem with a normalizing flow prior, we wish to estimate
  the distribution of the underlying signal conditioned on the observations. We approach
  this problem as a task of conditional inference on the pre-trained unconditional
  flow model. We first establish that this is computationally hard for a large class
  of flow models. Motivated by this, we propose a framework for approximate inference
  that estimates the target conditional as a composition of two flow models. This
  formulation leads to a stable variational inference training procedure that avoids
  adversarial training. Our method is evaluated on a variety of inverse problems and
  is shown to produce high-quality samples with uncertainty quantification. We further
  demonstrate that our approach can be amortized for zero-shot inference.
