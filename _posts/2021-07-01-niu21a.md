title: 'AdaXpert: Adapting Neural Architecture for Growing Data'
abstract: 'In real-world applications, data often come in a growing manner, where
  the data volume and the number of classes may increase dynamically. This will bring
  a critical challenge for learning: given the increasing data volume or the number
  of classes, one has to instantaneously adjust the neural model capacity to obtain
  promising performance. Existing methods either ignore the growing nature of data
  or seek to independently search an optimal architecture for a given dataset, and
  thus are incapable of promptly adjusting the architectures for the changed data.
  To address this, we present a neural architecture adaptation method, namely Adaptation
  eXpert (AdaXpert), to efficiently adjust previous architectures on the growing data.
  Specifically, we introduce an architecture adjuster to generate a suitable architecture
  for each data snapshot, based on the previous architecture and the different extent
  between current and previous data distributions. Furthermore, we propose an adaptation
  condition to determine the necessity of adjustment, thereby avoiding unnecessary
  and time-consuming adjustments. Extensive experiments on two growth scenarios (increasing
  data volume and number of classes) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
  method.'
