title: Is Space-Time Attention All You Need for Video Understanding?
abstract: 'We present a convolution-free approach to video classification built exclusively
  on self-attention over space and time. Our method, named “TimeSformer,” adapts the
  standard Transformer architecture to video by enabling spatiotemporal feature learning
  directly from a sequence of frame-level patches. Our experimental study compares
  different self-attention schemes and suggests that “divided attention,” where temporal
  attention and spatial attention are separately applied within each block, leads
  to the best video classification accuracy among the design choices considered. Despite
  the radically new design, TimeSformer achieves state-of-the-art results on several
  action recognition benchmarks, including the best reported accuracy on Kinetics-400
  and Kinetics-600. Finally, compared to 3D convolutional networks, our model is faster
  to train, it can achieve dramatically higher test efficiency (at a small drop in
  accuracy), and it can also be applied to much longer video clips (over one minute
  long). Code and models are available at: https://github.com/facebookresearch/TimeSformer.'
