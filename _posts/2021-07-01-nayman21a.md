title: 'HardCoRe-NAS: Hard Constrained diffeRentiable Neural Architecture Search'
abstract: Realistic use of neural networks often requires adhering to multiple constraints
  on latency, energy and memory among others. A popular approach to find fitting networks
  is through constrained Neural Architecture Search (NAS), however, previous methods
  enforce the constraint only softly. Therefore, the resulting networks do not exactly
  adhere to the resource constraint and their accuracy is harmed. In this work we
  resolve this by introducing Hard Constrained diffeRentiable NAS (HardCoRe-NAS),
  that is based on an accurate formulation of the expected resource requirement and
  a scalable search method that satisfies the hard constraint throughout the search.
  Our experiments show that HardCoRe-NAS generates state-of-the-art architectures,
  surpassing other NAS methods, while strictly satisfying the hard resource constraints
  without any tuning required.
