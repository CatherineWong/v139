title: 'Representation Matters: Assessing the Importance of Subgroup Allocations in
  Training Data'
abstract: Collecting more diverse and representative training data is often touted
  as a remedy for the disparate performance of machine learning predictors across
  subpopulations. However, a precise framework for understanding how dataset properties
  like diversity affect learning outcomes is largely lacking. By casting data collection
  as part of the learning process, we demonstrate that diverse representation in training
  data is key not only to increasing subgroup performances, but also to achieving
  population-level objectives. Our analysis and experiments describe how dataset compositions
  influence performance and provide constructive results for using trends in existing
  data, alongside domain knowledge, to help guide intentional, objective-aware dataset
