title: 'Rethinking Neural vs. Matrix-Factorization Collaborative Filtering: the Theoretical
  Perspectives'
abstract: 'The recent work by Rendle et al. (2020), based on empirical observations,
  argues that matrix-factorization collaborative filtering (MCF) compares favorably
  to neural collaborative filtering (NCF), and conjectures the dot productâ€™s superiority
  over the feed-forward neural network as similarity function. In this paper, we address
  the comparison rigorously by answering the following questions: 1. what is the limiting
  expressivity of each model; 2. under the practical gradient descent, to which solution
  does each optimization path converge; 3. how would the models generalize under the
  inductive and transductive learning setting. Our results highlight the similar expressivity
  for the overparameterized NCF and MCF as kernelized predictors, and reveal the relation
  between their optimization paths. We further show their different generalization
  behaviors, where MCF and NCF experience specific tradeoff and comparison in the
  transductive and inductive collaborative filtering setting. Lastly, by showing a
  novel generalization result, we reveal the critical role of correcting exposure
  bias for model evaluation in the inductive setting. Our results explain some of
  the previously observed conflicts, and we provide synthetic and real-data experiments
  to shed further insights to this topic.'
