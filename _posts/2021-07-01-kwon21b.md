title: 'ASAM: Adaptive Sharpness-Aware Minimization for Scale-Invariant Learning of
  Deep Neural Networks'
abstract: Recently, learning algorithms motivated from sharpness of loss surface as
  an effective measure of generalization gap have shown state-of-the-art performances.
  Nevertheless, sharpness defined in a rigid region with a fixed radius, has a drawback
  in sensitivity to parameter re-scaling which leaves the loss unaffected, leading
  to weakening of the connection between sharpness and generalization gap. In this
  paper, we introduce the concept of adaptive sharpness which is scale-invariant and
  propose the corresponding generalization bound. We suggest a novel learning method,
  adaptive sharpness-aware minimization (ASAM), utilizing the proposed generalization
  bound. Experimental results in various benchmark datasets show that ASAM contributes
  to significant improvement of model generalization performance.
