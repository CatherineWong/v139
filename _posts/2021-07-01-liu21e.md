title: Besov Function Approximation and Binary Classification on Low-Dimensional Manifolds
  Using Convolutional Residual Networks
abstract: Most of existing statistical theories on deep neural networks have sample
  complexities cursed by the data dimension and therefore cannot well explain the
  empirical success of deep learning on high-dimensional data. To bridge this gap,
  we propose to exploit the low-dimensional structures of the real world datasets
  and establish theoretical guarantees of convolutional residual networks (ConvResNet)
  in terms of function approximation and statistical recovery for binary classification
  problem. Specifically, given the data lying on a $d$-dimensional manifold isometrically
  embedded in $\mathbb{R}^D$, we prove that if the network architecture is properly
  chosen, ConvResNets can (1) approximate {\it Besov functions} on manifolds with
  arbitrary accuracy, and (2) learn a classifier by minimizing the empirical logistic
  risk, which gives an {\it excess risk} in the order of $n^{-\frac{s}{2s+2(s\vee
  d)}}$, where $s$ is a smoothness parameter. This implies that the sample complexity
  depends on the intrinsic dimension $d$, instead of the data dimension $D$. Our results
  demonstrate that ConvResNets are adaptive to low-dimensional structures of data
  sets.
