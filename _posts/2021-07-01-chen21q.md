title: Network Inference and Influence Maximization from Samples
abstract: Influence maximization is the task of selecting a small number of seed nodes
  in a social network to maximize the spread of the influence from these seeds, and
  it has been widely investigated in the past two decades. In the canonical setting,
  the whole social network as well as its diffusion parameters is given as input.
  In this paper, we consider the more realistic sampling setting where the network
  is unknown and we only have a set of passively observed cascades that record the
  set of activated nodes at each diffusion step. We study the task of influence maximization
  from these cascade samples (IMS), and present constant approximation algorithms
  for this task under mild conditions on the seed set distribution. To achieve the
  optimization goal, we also provide a novel solution to the network inference problem,
  that is, learning diffusion parameters and the network structure from the cascade
  data. Comparing with prior solutions, our network inference algorithm requires weaker
  assumptions and does not rely on maximum-likelihood estimation and convex programming.
  Our IMS algorithms enhance the learning-and-then-optimization approach by allowing
  a constant approximation ratio even when the diffusion parameters are hard to learn,
  and we do not need any assumption related to the network structure or diffusion
  parameters.
