title: 'UneVEn: Universal Value Exploration for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning'
abstract: VDN and QMIX are two popular value-based algorithms for cooperative MARL
  that learn a centralized action value function as a monotonic mixing of per-agent
  utilities. While this enables easy decentralization of the learned policy, the restricted
  joint action value function can prevent them from solving tasks that require significant
  coordination between agents at a given timestep. We show that this problem can be
  overcome by improving the joint exploration of all agents during training. Specifically,
  we propose a novel MARL approach called Universal Value Exploration (UneVEn) that
  learns a set of related tasks simultaneously with a linear decomposition of universal
  successor features. With the policies of already solved related tasks, the joint
  exploration process of all agents can be improved to help them achieve better coordination.
  Empirical results on a set of exploration games, challenging cooperative predator-prey
  tasks requiring significant coordination among agents, and StarCraft II micromanagement
  benchmarks show that UneVEn can solve tasks where other state-of-the-art MARL methods
  fail.
