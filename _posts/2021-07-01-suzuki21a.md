title: Generalization Error Bound for Hyperbolic Ordinal Embedding
abstract: Hyperbolic ordinal embedding (HOE) represents entities as points in hyperbolic
  space so that they agree as well as possible with given constraints in the form
  of entity $i$ is more similar to entity $j$ than to entity $k$. It has been experimentally
  shown that HOE can obtain representations of hierarchical data such as a knowledge
  base and a citation network effectively, owing to hyperbolic space’s exponential
  growth property. However, its theoretical analysis has been limited to ideal noiseless
  settings, and its generalization error in compensation for hyperbolic space’s exponential
  representation ability has not been guaranteed. The difficulty is that existing
  generalization error bound derivations for ordinal embedding based on the Gramian
  matrix are not applicable in HOE, since hyperbolic space is not inner-product space.
  In this paper, through our novel characterization of HOE with decomposed Lorentz
  Gramian matrices, we provide a generalization error bound of HOE for the first time,
  which is at most exponential with respect to the embedding space’s radius. Our comparison
  between the bounds of HOE and Euclidean ordinal embedding shows that HOE’s generalization
  error comes at a reasonable cost considering its exponential representation ability.
