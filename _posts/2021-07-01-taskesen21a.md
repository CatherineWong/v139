title: Sequential Domain Adaptation by Synthesizing Distributionally Robust Experts
abstract: Least squares estimators, when trained on few target domain samples, may
  predict poorly. Supervised domain adaptation aims to improve the predictive accuracy
  by exploiting additional labeled training samples from a source distribution that
  is close to the target distribution. Given available data, we investigate novel
  strategies to synthesize a family of least squares estimator experts that are robust
  with regard to moment conditions. When these moment conditions are specified using
  Kullback-Leibler or Wasserstein-type divergences, we can find the robust estimators
  efficiently using convex optimization. We use the Bernstein online aggregation algorithm
  on the proposed family of robust experts to generate predictions for the sequential
  stream of target test samples. Numerical experiments on real data show that the
  robust strategies systematically outperform non-robust interpolations of the empirical
  least squares estimators.
