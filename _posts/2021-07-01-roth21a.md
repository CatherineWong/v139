title: Simultaneous Similarity-based Self-Distillation for Deep Metric Learning
abstract: Deep Metric Learning (DML) provides a crucial tool for visual similarity
  and zero-shot retrieval applications by learning generalizing embedding spaces,
  although recent work in DML has shown strong performance saturation across training
  objectives. However, generalization capacity is known to scale with the embedding
  space dimensionality. Unfortunately, high dimensional embeddings also create higher
  retrieval cost for downstream applications. To remedy this, we propose S2SD - Simultaneous
  Similarity-based Self-distillation. S2SD extends DML with knowledge distillation
  from auxiliary, high-dimensional embedding and feature spaces to leverage complementary
  context during training while retaining test-time cost and with negligible changes
  to the training time. Experiments and ablations across different objectives and
  standard benchmarks show S2SD offering highly significant improvements of up to
  7% in Recall@1, while also setting a new state-of-the-art.
