title: Information Obfuscation of Graph Neural Networks
abstract: While the advent of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has greatly improved node
  and graph representation learning in many applications, the neighborhood aggregation
  scheme exposes additional vulnerabilities to adversaries seeking to extract node-level
  information about sensitive attributes. In this paper, we study the problem of protecting
  sensitive attributes by information obfuscation when learning with graph structured
  data. We propose a framework to locally filter out pre-determined sensitive attributes
  via adversarial training with the total variation and the Wasserstein distance.
  Our method creates a strong defense against inference attacks, while only suffering
  small loss in task performance. Theoretically, we analyze the effectiveness of our
  framework against a worst-case adversary, and characterize an inherent trade-off
  between maximizing predictive accuracy and minimizing information leakage. Experiments
  across multiple datasets from recommender systems, knowledge graphs and quantum
  chemistry demonstrate that the proposed approach provides a robust defense across
  various graph structures and tasks, while producing competitive GNN encoders for
  downstream tasks.
