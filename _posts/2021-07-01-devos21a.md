title: Versatile Verification of Tree Ensembles
abstract: Machine learned models often must abide by certain requirements (e.g., fairness
  or legal). This has spurred interested in developing approaches that can provably
  verify whether a model satisfies certain properties. This paper introduces a generic
  algorithm called Veritas that enables tackling multiple different verification tasks
  for tree ensemble models like random forests (RFs) and gradient boosted decision
  trees (GBDTs). This generality contrasts with previous work, which has focused exclusively
  on either adversarial example generation or robustness checking. Veritas formulates
  the verification task as a generic optimization problem and introduces a novel search
  space representation. Veritas offers two key advantages. First, it provides anytime
  lower and upper bounds when the optimization problem cannot be solved exactly. In
  contrast, many existing methods have focused on exact solutions and are thus limited
  by the verification problem being NP-complete. Second, Veritas produces full (bounded
  suboptimal) solutions that can be used to generate concrete examples. We experimentally
  show that our method produces state-of-the-art robustness estimates, especially
  when executed with strict time constraints. This is exceedingly important when checking
  the robustness of large datasets. Additionally, we show that Veritas enables tackling
  more real-world verification scenarios.
