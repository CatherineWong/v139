title: Implicit rate-constrained optimization of non-decomposable objectives
abstract: We consider a popular family of constrained optimization problems arising
  in machine learning that involve optimizing a non-decomposable evaluation metric
  with a certain thresholded form, while constraining another metric of interest.
  Examples of such problems include optimizing false negative rate at a fixed false
  positive rate, optimizing precision at a fixed recall, optimizing the area under
  the precision-recall or ROC curves, etc. Our key idea is to formulate a rate-constrained
  optimization that expresses the threshold parameter as a function of the model parameters
  via the Implicit Function theorem. We show how the resulting optimization problem
  can be solved using standard gradient based methods. Experiments on benchmark datasets
  demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method over existing state-of-the-art
  approaches for these problems.
