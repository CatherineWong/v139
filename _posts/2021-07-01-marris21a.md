title: Multi-Agent Training beyond Zero-Sum with Correlated Equilibrium Meta-Solvers
abstract: Two-player, constant-sum games are well studied in the literature, but there
  has been limited progress outside of this setting. We propose Joint Policy-Space
  Response Oracles (JPSRO), an algorithm for training agents in n-player, general-sum
  extensive form games, which provably converges to an equilibrium. We further suggest
  correlated equilibria (CE) as promising meta-solvers, and propose a novel solution
  concept Maximum Gini Correlated Equilibrium (MGCE), a principled and computationally
  efficient family of solutions for solving the correlated equilibrium selection problem.
  We conduct several experiments using CE meta-solvers for JPSRO and demonstrate convergence
  on n-player, general-sum games.
