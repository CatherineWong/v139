title: Stochastic Iterative Graph Matching
abstract: Recent works apply Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to graph matching tasks
  and show promising results. Considering that model outputs are complex matchings,
  we devise several techniques to improve the learning of GNNs and obtain a new model,
  Stochastic Iterative Graph MAtching (SIGMA). Our model predicts a distribution of
  matchings, instead of a single matching, for a graph pair so the model can explore
  several probable matchings. We further introduce a novel multi-step matching procedure,
  which learns how to refine a graph pairâ€™s matching results incrementally. The model
  also includes dummy nodes so that the model does not have to find matchings for
  nodes without correspondence. We fit this model to data via scalable stochastic
  optimization. We conduct extensive experiments across synthetic graph datasets as
  well as biochemistry and computer vision applications. Across all tasks, our results
  show that SIGMA can produce significantly improved graph matching results compared
  to state-of-the-art models. Ablation studies verify that each of our components
  (stochastic training, iterative matching, and dummy nodes) offers noticeable improvement.
