title: 'Adaptive Newton Sketch: Linear-time Optimization with Quadratic Convergence
  and Effective Hessian Dimensionality'
abstract: 'We propose a randomized algorithm with quadratic convergence rate for convex
  optimization problems with a self-concordant, composite, strongly convex objective
  function. Our method is based on performing an approximate Newton step using a random
  projection of the Hessian. Our first contribution is to show that, at each iteration,
  the embedding dimension (or sketch size) can be as small as the effective dimension
  of the Hessian matrix. Leveraging this novel fundamental result, we design an algorithm
  with a sketch size proportional to the effective dimension and which exhibits a
  quadratic rate of convergence. This result dramatically improves on the classical
  linear-quadratic convergence rates of state-of-the-art sub-sampled Newton methods.
  However, in most practical cases, the effective dimension is not known beforehand,
  and this raises the question of how to pick a sketch size as small as the effective
  dimension while preserving a quadratic convergence rate. Our second and main contribution
  is thus to propose an adaptive sketch size algorithm with quadratic convergence
  rate and which does not require prior knowledge or estimation of the effective dimension:
  at each iteration, it starts with a small sketch size, and increases it until quadratic
  progress is achieved. Importantly, we show that the embedding dimension remains
  proportional to the effective dimension throughout the entire path and that our
  method achieves state-of-the-art computational complexity for solving convex optimization
  programs with a strongly convex component. We discuss and illustrate applications
  to linear and quadratic programming, as well as logistic regression and other generalized
  linear models.'
