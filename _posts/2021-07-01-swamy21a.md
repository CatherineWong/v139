title: 'Of Moments and Matching: A Game-Theoretic Framework for Closing the Imitation
  Gap'
abstract: We provide a unifying view of a large family of previous imitation learning
  algorithms through the lens of moment matching. At its core, our classification
  scheme is based on whether the learner attempts to match (1) reward or (2) action-value
  moments of the expertâ€™s behavior, with each option leading to differing algorithmic
  approaches. By considering adversarially chosen divergences between learner and
  expert behavior, we are able to derive bounds on policy performance that apply for
  all algorithms in each of these classes, the first to our knowledge. We also introduce
  the notion of moment recoverability, implicit in many previous analyses of imitation
  learning, which allows us to cleanly delineate how well each algorithmic family
  is able to mitigate compounding errors. We derive three novel algorithm templates
  (AdVIL, AdRIL, and DAeQuIL) with strong guarantees, simple implementation, and competitive
  empirical performance.
