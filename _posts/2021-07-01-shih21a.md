title: 'GANMEX: One-vs-One Attributions using GAN-based Model Explainability'
abstract: Attribution methods have been shown as promising approaches for identifying
  key features that led to learned model predictions. While most existing attribution
  methods rely on a baseline input for performing feature perturbations, limited research
  has been conducted to address the baseline selection issues. Poor choices of baselines
  limit the ability of one-vs-one explanations for multi-class classifiers, which
  means the attribution methods were not able to explain why an input belongs to its
  original class but not the other specified target class. Achieving one-vs-one explanation
  is crucial when certain classes are more similar than others, e.g. two bird types
  among multiple animals, by focusing on key differentiating features rather than
  shared features across classes. In this paper, we present GANMEX, a novel approach
  applying Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) by incorporating the to-be-explained
  classifier as part of the adversarial networks. Our approach effectively selects
  the baseline as the closest realistic sample belong to the target class, which allows
  attribution methods to provide true one-vs-one explanations. We showed that GANMEX
  baselines improved the saliency maps and led to stronger performance on multiple
  evaluation metrics over the existing baselines. Existing attribution results are
  known for being insensitive to model randomization, and we demonstrated that GANMEX
  baselines led to better outcome under the cascading randomization of the model.
