title: Offline Reinforcement Learning with Pseudometric Learning
abstract: 'Offline Reinforcement Learning methods seek to learn a policy from logged
  transitions of an environment, without any interaction. In the presence of function
  approximation, and under the assumption of limited coverage of the state-action
  space of the environment, it is necessary to enforce the policy to visit state-action
  pairs close to the support of logged transitions. In this work, we propose an iterative
  procedure to learn a pseudometric (closely related to bisimulation metrics) from
  logged transitions, and use it to define this notion of closeness. We show its convergence
  and extend it to the function approximation setting. We then use this pseudometric
  to define a new lookup based bonus in an actor-critic algorithm: PLOFF. This bonus
  encourages the actor to stay close, in terms of the defined pseudometric, to the
  support of logged transitions. Finally, we evaluate the method on hand manipulation
  and locomotion tasks.'
