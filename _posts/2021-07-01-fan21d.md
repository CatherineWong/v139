title: Scalable Computations of Wasserstein Barycenter via Input Convex Neural Networks
abstract: 'Wasserstein Barycenter is a principled approach to represent the weighted
  mean of a given set of probability distributions, utilizing the geometry induced
  by optimal transport. In this work, we present a novel scalable algorithm to approximate
  the Wasserstein Barycenters aiming at high-dimensional applications in machine learning.
  Our proposed algorithm is based on the Kantorovich dual formulation of the Wasserstein-2
  distance as well as a recent neural network architecture, input convex neural network,
  that is known to parametrize convex functions. The distinguishing features of our
  method are: i) it only requires samples from the marginal distributions; ii) unlike
  the existing approaches, it represents the Barycenter with a generative model and
  can thus generate infinite samples from the barycenter without querying the marginal
  distributions; iii) it works similar to Generative Adversarial Model in one marginal
  case. We demonstratethe efficacy of our algorithm by comparing it with the state-of-art
  methods in multiple experiments.'
