title: Autoencoder Image Interpolation by Shaping the Latent Space
abstract: One of the fascinating properties of deep learning is the ability of the
  network to reveal the underlying factors characterizing elements in datasets of
  different types. Autoencoders represent an effective approach for computing these
  factors. Autoencoders have been studied in the context of enabling interpolation
  between data points by decoding convex combinations of latent vectors. However,
  this interpolation often leads to artifacts or produces unrealistic results during
  reconstruction. We argue that these incongruities are due to the structure of the
  latent space and to the fact that such naively interpolated latent vectors deviate
  from the data manifold. In this paper, we propose a regularization technique that
  shapes the latent representation to follow a manifold that is consistent with the
  training images and that forces the manifold to be smooth and locally convex. This
  regularization not only enables faithful interpolation between data points, as we
  show herein but can also be used as a general regularization technique to avoid
  overfitting or to produce new samples for data augmentation.
