title: Robust Testing and Estimation under Manipulation Attacks
abstract: We study robust testing and estimation of discrete distributions in the
  strong contamination model. Our results cover both centralized setting and distributed
  setting with general local information constraints including communication and LDP
  constraints. Our technique relates the strength of manipulation attacks to the earth-mover
  distance using Hamming distance as the metric between messages (samples) from the
  users. In the centralized setting, we provide optimal error bounds for both learning
  and testing. Our lower bounds under local information constraints build on the recent
  lower bound methods in distributed inference. In the communication constrained setting,
  we develop novel algorithms based on random hashing and an L1-L1 isometry.
