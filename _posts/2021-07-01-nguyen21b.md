title: Value-at-Risk Optimization with Gaussian Processes
abstract: Value-at-risk (VaR) is an established measure to assess risks in critical
  real-world applications with random environmental factors. This paper presents a
  novel VaR upper confidence bound (V-UCB) algorithm for maximizing the VaR of a black-box
  objective function with the first no-regret guarantee. To realize this, we first
  derive a confidence bound of VaR and then prove the existence of values of the environmental
  random variable (to be selected to achieve no regret) such that the confidence bound
  of VaR lies within that of the objective function evaluated at such values. Our
  V-UCB algorithm empirically demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in optimizing
  synthetic benchmark functions, a portfolio optimization problem, and a simulated
  robot task.
