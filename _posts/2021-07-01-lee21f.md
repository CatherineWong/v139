title: 'OptiDICE: Offline Policy Optimization via Stationary Distribution Correction
  Estimation'
abstract: We consider the offline reinforcement learning (RL) setting where the agent
  aims to optimize the policy solely from the data without further environment interactions.
  In offline RL, the distributional shift becomes the primary source of difficulty,
  which arises from the deviation of the target policy being optimized from the behavior
  policy used for data collection. This typically causes overestimation of action
  values, which poses severe problems for model-free algorithms that use bootstrapping.
  To mitigate the problem, prior offline RL algorithms often used sophisticated techniques
  that encourage underestimation of action values, which introduces an additional
  set of hyperparameters that need to be tuned properly. In this paper, we present
  an offline RL algorithm that prevents overestimation in a more principled way. Our
  algorithm, OptiDICE, directly estimates the stationary distribution corrections
  of the optimal policy and does not rely on policy-gradients, unlike previous offline
  RL algorithms. Using an extensive set of benchmark datasets for offline RL, we show
  that OptiDICE performs competitively with the state-of-the-art methods.
