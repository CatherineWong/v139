title: Group Fisher Pruning for Practical Network Compression
abstract: Network compression has been widely studied since it is able to reduce the
  memory and computation cost during inference. However, previous methods seldom deal
  with complicated structures like residual connections, group/depth-wise convolution
  and feature pyramid network, where channels of multiple layers are coupled and need
  to be pruned simultaneously. In this paper, we present a general channel pruning
  approach that can be applied to various complicated structures. Particularly, we
  propose a layer grouping algorithm to find coupled channels automatically. Then
  we derive a unified metric based on Fisher information to evaluate the importance
  of a single channel and coupled channels. Moreover, we find that inference speedup
  on GPUs is more correlated with the reduction of memory rather than FLOPs, and thus
  we employ the memory reduction of each channel to normalize the importance. Our
  method can be used to prune any structures including those with coupled channels.
  We conduct extensive experiments on various backbones, including the classic ResNet
  and ResNeXt, mobile-friendly MobileNetV2, and the NAS-based RegNet, both on image
  classification and object detection which is under-explored. Experimental results
  validate that our method can effectively prune sophisticated networks, boosting
  inference speed without sacrificing accuracy.
