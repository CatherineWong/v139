title: 'Meta-Cal: Well-controlled Post-hoc Calibration by Ranking'
abstract: In many applications, it is desirable that a classifier not only makes accurate
  predictions, but also outputs calibrated posterior probabilities. However, many
  existing classifiers, especially deep neural network classifiers, tend to be uncalibrated.
  Post-hoc calibration is a technique to recalibrate a model by learning a calibration
  map. Existing approaches mostly focus on constructing calibration maps with low
  calibration errors, however, this quality is inadequate for a calibrator being useful.
  In this paper, we introduce two constraints that are worth consideration in designing
  a calibration map for post-hoc calibration. Then we present Meta-Cal, which is built
  from a base calibrator and a ranking model. Under some mild assumptions, two high-probability
  bounds are given with respect to these constraints. Empirical results on CIFAR-10,
  CIFAR-100 and ImageNet and a range of popular network architectures show our proposed
  method significantly outperforms the current state of the art for post-hoc multi-class
  classification calibration.
