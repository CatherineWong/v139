title: A Value-Function-based Interior-point Method for Non-convex Bi-level Optimization
abstract: Bi-level optimization model is able to capture a wide range of complex learning
  tasks with practical interest. Due to the witnessed efficiency in solving bi-level
  programs, gradient-based methods have gained popularity in the machine learning
  community. In this work, we propose a new gradient-based solution scheme, namely,
  the Bi-level Value-Function-based Interior-point Method (BVFIM). Following the main
  idea of the log-barrier interior-point scheme, we penalize the regularized value
  function of the lower level problem into the upper level objective. By further solving
  a sequence of differentiable unconstrained approximation problems, we consequently
  derive a sequential programming scheme. The numerical advantage of our scheme relies
  on the fact that, when gradient methods are applied to solve the approximation problem,
  we successfully avoid computing any expensive Hessian-vector or Jacobian-vector
  product. We prove the convergence without requiring any convexity assumption on
  either the upper level or the lower level objective. Experiments demonstrate the
  efficiency of the proposed BVFIM on non-convex bi-level problems.
