title: Budgeted Heterogeneous Treatment Effect Estimation
abstract: Heterogeneous treatment effect (HTE) estimation is receiving increasing
  interest due to its important applications in fields such as healthcare, economics,
  and education. Current HTE estimation methods generally assume the existence of
  abundant observational data, though the acquisition of such data can be costly.
  In some real scenarios, it is easy to access the pre-treatment covariates and treatment
  assignments, but expensive to obtain the factual outcomes. To make HTE estimation
  more practical, in this paper, we examine the problem of estimating HTEs with a
  budget constraint on observational data, aiming to obtain accurate HTE estimates
  with limited costs. By deriving an informative generalization bound and connecting
  to active learning, we propose an effective and efficient method which is validated
  both theoretically and empirically.
