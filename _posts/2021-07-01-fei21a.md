title: 'Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement Learning with Function Approximation: A Debiasing
  Approach'
abstract: We study function approximation for episodic reinforcement learning with
  entropic risk measure. We first propose an algorithm with linear function approximation.
  Compared to existing algorithms, which suffer from improper regularization and regression
  biases, this algorithm features debiasing transformations in backward induction
  and regression procedures. We further propose an algorithm with general function
  approximation, which features implicit debiasing transformations. We prove that
  both algorithms achieve a sublinear regret and demonstrate a trade-off between generality
  and efficiency. Our analysis provides a unified framework for function approximation
  in risk-sensitive reinforcement learning, which leads to the first sublinear regret
  bounds in the setting.
