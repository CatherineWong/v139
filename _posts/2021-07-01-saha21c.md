title: Optimal regret algorithm for Pseudo-1d Bandit Convex Optimization
abstract: We study online learning with bandit feedback (i.e. learner has access to
  only zeroth-order oracle) where cost/reward functions $\f_t$ admit a "pseudo-1d"
  structure, i.e. $\f_t(\w) = \loss_t(\pred_t(\w))$ where the output of $\pred_t$
  is one-dimensional. At each round, the learner observes context $\x_t$, plays prediction
  $\pred_t(\w_t; \x_t)$ (e.g. $\pred_t(\cdot)=⟨\x_t, \cdot⟩$) for some $\w_t \in \mathbb{R}^d$
  and observes loss $\loss_t(\pred_t(\w_t))$ where $\loss_t$ is a convex Lipschitz-continuous
  function. The goal is to minimize the standard regret metric. This pseudo-1d bandit
  convex optimization problem (\SBCO) arises frequently in domains such as online
  decision-making or parameter-tuning in large systems. For this problem, we first
  show a regret lower bound of $\min(\sqrt{dT}, T^{3/4})$ for any algorithm, where
  $T$ is the number of rounds. We propose a new algorithm \sbcalg that combines randomized
  online gradient descent with a kernelized exponential weights method to exploit
  the pseudo-1d structure effectively, guaranteeing the {\em optimal} regret bound
  mentioned above, up to additional logarithmic factors. In contrast, applying state-of-the-art
  online convex optimization methods leads to $\tilde{O}\left(\min\left(d^{9.5}\sqrt{T},\sqrt{d}T^{3/4}\right)\right)$
  regret, that is significantly suboptimal in terms of $d$.
