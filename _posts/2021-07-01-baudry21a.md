title: Optimal Thompson Sampling strategies for support-aware CVaR bandits
abstract: In this paper we study a multi-arm bandit problem in which the quality of
  each arm is measured by the Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) at some level alpha
  of the reward distribution. While existing works in this setting mainly focus on
  Upper Confidence Bound algorithms, we introduce a new Thompson Sampling approach
  for CVaR bandits on bounded rewards that is flexible enough to solve a variety of
  problems grounded on physical resources. Building on a recent work by Riou & Honda
  (2020), we introduce B-CVTS for continuous bounded rewards and M-CVTS for multinomial
  distributions. On the theoretical side, we provide a non-trivial extension of their
  analysis that enables to theoretically bound their CVaR regret minimization performance.
  Strikingly, our results show that these strategies are the first to provably achieve
  asymptotic optimality in CVaR bandits, matching the corresponding asymptotic lower
  bounds for this setting. Further, we illustrate empirically the benefit of Thompson
  Sampling approaches both in a realistic environment simulating a use-case in agriculture
  and on various synthetic examples.
