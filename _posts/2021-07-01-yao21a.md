title: 'HAWQ-V3: Dyadic Neural Network Quantization'
abstract: 'Current low-precision quantization algorithms often have the hidden cost
  of conversion back and forth from floating point to quantized integer values. This
  hidden cost limits the latency improvement realized by quantizing Neural Networks.
  To address this, we present HAWQ-V3, a novel mixed-precision integer-only quantization
  framework. The contributions of HAWQ-V3 are the following: (i) An integer-only inference
  where the entire computational graph is performed only with integer multiplication,
  addition, and bit shifting, without any floating point operations or even integer
  division; (ii) A novel hardware-aware mixed-precision quantization method where
  the bit-precision is calculated by solving an integer linear programming problem
  that balances the trade-off between model perturbation and other constraints, e.g.,
  memory footprint and latency; (iii) Direct hardware deployment and open source contribution
  for 4-bit uniform/mixed-precision quantization in TVM, achieving an average speed
  up of 1.45x for uniform 4-bit, as compared to uniform 8-bit for ResNet50 on T4 GPUs;
  and (iv) extensive evaluation of the proposed methods on ResNet18/50 and InceptionV3,
  for various model compression levels with/without mixed precision. For ResNet50,
  our INT8 quantization achieves an accuracy of 77.58%, which is 2.68% higher than
  prior integer-only work, and our mixed-precision INT4/8 quantization can reduce
  INT8 latency by 23% and still achieve 76.73% accuracy. Our framework and the TVM
  implementation have been open sourced (HAWQ, 2020).'
