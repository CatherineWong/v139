title: Off-Policy Confidence Sequences
abstract: We develop confidence bounds that hold uniformly over time for off-policy
  evaluation in the contextual bandit setting. These confidence sequences are based
  on recent ideas from martingale analysis and are non-asymptotic, non-parametric,
  and valid at arbitrary stopping times. We provide algorithms for computing these
  confidence sequences that strike a good balance between computational and statistical
  efficiency. We empirically demonstrate the tightness of our approach in terms of
  failure probability and width and apply it to the “gated deployment” problem of
  safely upgrading a production contextual bandit system.
