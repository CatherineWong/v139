title: Interpreting and Disentangling Feature Components of Various Complexity from
  DNNs
abstract: This paper aims to define, visualize, and analyze the feature complexity
  that is learned by a DNN. We propose a generic definition for the feature complexity.
  Given the feature of a certain layer in the DNN, our method decomposes and visualizes
  feature components of different complexity orders from the feature. The feature
  decomposition enables us to evaluate the reliability, the effectiveness, and the
  significance of over-fitting of these feature components. Furthermore, such analysis
  helps to improve the performance of DNNs. As a generic method, the feature complexity
  also provides new insights into existing deep-learning techniques, such as network
  compression and knowledge distillation.
