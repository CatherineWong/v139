title: Monotonic Robust Policy Optimization with Model Discrepancy
abstract: State-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms tend to overfit
  due to the model discrepancy between source and target environments. Though applying
  domain randomization during training can improve the average performance by randomly
  generating a sufficient diversity of environments in simulator, the worst-case environment
  is still neglected without any performance guarantee. Since the average and worst-case
  performance are both important for generalization in RL, in this paper, we propose
  a policy optimization approach for concurrently improving the policyâ€™s performance
  in the average and worst-case environment. We theoretically derive a lower bound
  for the worst-case performance of a given policy by relating it to the expected
  performance. Guided by this lower bound, we formulate an optimization problem to
  jointly optimize the policy and sampling distribution, and prove that by iteratively
  solving it the worst-case performance is monotonically improved. We then develop
  a practical algorithm, named monotonic robust policy optimization (MRPO). Experimental
  evaluations in several robot control tasks demonstrate that MRPO can generally improve
  both the average and worst-case performance in the source environments for training,
  and facilitate in all cases the learned policy with a better generalization capability
  in some unseen testing environments.
