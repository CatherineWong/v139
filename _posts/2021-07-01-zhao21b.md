title: Joining datasets via data augmentation in the label space for neural networks
abstract: 'Most, if not all, modern deep learning systems restrict themselves to a
  single dataset for neural network training and inference. In this article, we are
  interested in systematic ways to join datasets that are made of similar purposes.
  Unlike previous published works that ubiquitously conduct the dataset joining in
  the uninterpretable latent vectorial space, the core to our method is an augmentation
  procedure in the label space. The primary challenge to address the label space for
  dataset joining is the discrepancy between labels: non-overlapping label annotation
  sets, different labeling granularity or hierarchy and etc. Notably we propose a
  new technique leveraging artificially created knowledge graph, recurrent neural
  networks and policy gradient that successfully achieve the dataset joining in the
  label space. Empirical results on both image and text classification justify the
  validity of our approach.'
