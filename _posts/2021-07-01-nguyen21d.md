title: Optimal Transport Kernels for Sequential and Parallel Neural Architecture Search
abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) automates the design of deep neural networks.
  One of the main challenges in searching complex and non-continuous architectures
  is to compare the similarity of networks that the conventional Euclidean metric
  may fail to capture. Optimal transport (OT) is resilient to such complex structure
  by considering the minimal cost for transporting a network into another. However,
  the OT is generally not negative definite which may limit its ability to build the
  positive-definite kernels required in many kernel-dependent frameworks. Building
  upon tree-Wasserstein (TW), which is a negative definite variant of OT, we develop
  a novel discrepancy for neural architectures, and demonstrate it within a Gaussian
  process surrogate model for the sequential NAS settings. Furthermore, we derive
  a novel parallel NAS, using quality k-determinantal point process on the GP posterior,
  to select diverse and high-performing architectures from a discrete set of candidates.
  Empirically, we demonstrate that our TW-based approaches outperform other baselines
  in both sequential and parallel NAS.
