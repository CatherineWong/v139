title: Consensus Control for Decentralized Deep Learning
abstract: 'Decentralized training of deep learning models enables on-device learning
  over networks, as well as efficient scaling to large compute clusters. Experiments
  in earlier works reveal that, even in a data-center setup, decentralized training
  often suffers from the degradation in the quality of the model: the training and
  test performance of models trained in a decentralized fashion is in general worse
  than that of models trained in a centralized fashion, and this performance drop
  is impacted by parameters such as network size, communication topology and data
  partitioning. We identify the changing consensus distance between devices as a key
  parameter to explain the gap between centralized and decentralized training. We
  show in theory that when the training consensus distance is lower than a critical
  quantity, decentralized training converges as fast as the centralized counterpart.
  We empirically validate that the relation between generalization performance and
  consensus distance is consistent with this theoretical observation. Our empirical
  insights allow the principled design of better decentralized training schemes that
  mitigate the performance drop. To this end, we provide practical training guidelines
  and exemplify its effectiveness on the data-center setup as the important first
  step.'
