title: Provably Efficient Algorithms for Multi-Objective Competitive RL
abstract: We study multi-objective reinforcement learning (RL) where an agent’s reward
  is represented as a vector. In settings where an agent competes against opponents,
  its performance is measured by the distance of its average return vector to a target
  set. We develop statistically and computationally efficient algorithms to approach
  the associated target set. Our results extend Blackwell’s approachability theorem \citep{blackwell1956analog}
  to tabular RL, where strategic exploration becomes essential. The algorithms presented
  are adaptive; their guarantees hold even without Blackwell’s approachability condition.
  If the opponents use fixed policies, we give an improved rate of approaching the
  target set while also tackling the more ambitious goal of simultaneously minimizing
  a scalar cost function. We discuss our analysis for this special case by relating
  our results to previous works on constrained RL. To our knowledge, this work provides
  the first provably efficient algorithms for vector-valued Markov games and our theoretical
  guarantees are near-optimal.
