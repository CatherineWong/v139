title: Riemannian Convex Potential Maps
abstract: Modeling distributions on Riemannian manifolds is a crucial component in
  understanding non-Euclidean data that arises, e.g., in physics and geology. The
  budding approaches in this space are limited by representational and computational
  tradeoffs. We propose and study a class of flows that uses convex potentials from
  Riemannian optimal transport. These are universal and can model distributions on
  any compact Riemannian manifold without requiring domain knowledge of the manifold
  to be integrated into the architecture. We demonstrate that these flows can model
  standard distributions on spheres, and tori, on synthetic and geological data.
