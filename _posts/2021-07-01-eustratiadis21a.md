title: Weight-covariance alignment for adversarially robust neural networks
abstract: Stochastic Neural Networks (SNNs) that inject noise into their hidden layers
  have recently been shown to achieve strong robustness against adversarial attacks.
  However, existing SNNs are usually heuristically motivated, and often rely on adversarial
  training, which is computationally costly. We propose a new SNN that achieves state-of-the-art
  performance without relying on adversarial training, and enjoys solid theoretical
  justification. Specifically, while existing SNNs inject learned or hand-tuned isotropic
  noise, our SNN learns an anisotropic noise distribution to optimize a learning-theoretic
  bound on adversarial robustness. We evaluate our method on a number of popular benchmarks,
  show that it can be applied to different architectures, and that it provides robustness
  to a variety of white-box and black-box attacks, while being simple and fast to
  train compared to existing alternatives.
