title: 'SPADE: A Spectral Method for Black-Box Adversarial Robustness Evaluation'
abstract: A black-box spectral method is introduced for evaluating the adversarial
  robustness of a given machine learning (ML) model. Our approach, named SPADE, exploits
  bijective distance mapping between the input/output graphs constructed for approximating
  the manifolds corresponding to the input/output data. By leveraging the generalized
  Courant-Fischer theorem, we propose a SPADE score for evaluating the adversarial
  robustness of a given model, which is proved to be an upper bound of the best Lipschitz
  constant under the manifold setting. To reveal the most non-robust data samples
  highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, we develop a spectral graph embedding
  procedure leveraging dominant generalized eigenvectors. This embedding step allows
  assigning each data point a robustness score that can be further harnessed for more
  effective adversarial training of ML models. Our experiments show promising empirical
  results for neural networks trained with the MNIST and CIFAR-10 data sets.
