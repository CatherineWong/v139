title: 'Representation Matters: Offline Pretraining for Sequential Decision Making'
abstract: The recent success of supervised learning methods on ever larger offline
  datasets has spurred interest in the reinforcement learning (RL) field to investigate
  whether the same paradigms can be translated to RL algorithms. This research area,
  known as offline RL, has largely focused on offline policy optimization, aiming
  to find a return-maximizing policy exclusively from offline data. In this paper,
  we consider a slightly different approach to incorporating offline data into sequential
  decision-making. We aim to answer the question, what unsupervised objectives applied
  to offline datasets are able to learn state representations which elevate performance
  on downstream tasks, whether those downstream tasks be online RL, imitation learning
  from expert demonstrations, or even offline policy optimization based on the same
  offline dataset? Through a variety of experiments utilizing standard offline RL
  datasets, we find that the use of pretraining with unsupervised learning objectives
  can dramatically improve the performance of policy learning algorithms that otherwise
  yield mediocre performance on their own. Extensive ablations further provide insights
  into what components of these unsupervised objectives {–} e.g., reward prediction,
  continuous or discrete representations, pretraining or finetuning {–} are most important
  and in which settings.
