title: Boosting the Throughput and Accelerator Utilization of Specialized CNN Inference
  Beyond Increasing Batch Size
abstract: 'Datacenter vision systems widely use small, specialized convolutional neural
  networks (CNNs) trained on specific tasks for high-throughput inference. These settings
  employ accelerators with massive computational capacity, but which specialized CNNs
  underutilize due to having low arithmetic intensity. This results in suboptimal
  application-level throughput and poor returns on accelerator investment. Increasing
  batch size is the only known way to increase both application-level throughput and
  accelerator utilization for inference, but yields diminishing returns; specialized
  CNNs poorly utilize accelerators even with large batch size. We propose FoldedCNNs,
  a new approach to CNN design that increases inference throughput and utilization
  beyond large batch size. FoldedCNNs rethink the structure of inputs and layers of
  specialized CNNs to boost arithmetic intensity: in FoldedCNNs, f images with C channels
  each are concatenated into a single input with fC channels and jointly classified
  by a wider CNN. Increased arithmetic intensity in FoldedCNNs increases the throughput
  and GPU utilization of specialized CNN inference by up to 2.5x and 2.8x, with accuracy
  close to the original CNN in most cases.'
