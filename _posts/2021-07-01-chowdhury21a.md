title: Modeling Hierarchical Structures with Continuous Recursive Neural Networks
abstract: Recursive Neural Networks (RvNNs), which compose sequences according to
  their underlying hierarchical syntactic structure, have performed well in several
  natural language processing tasks compared to similar models without structural
  biases. However, traditional RvNNs are incapable of inducing the latent structure
  in a plain text sequence on their own. Several extensions have been proposed to
  overcome this limitation. Nevertheless, these extensions tend to rely on surrogate
  gradients or reinforcement learning at the cost of higher bias or variance. In this
  work, we propose Continuous Recursive Neural Network (CRvNN) as a backpropagation-friendly
  alternative to address the aforementioned limitations. This is done by incorporating
  a continuous relaxation to the induced structure. We demonstrate that CRvNN achieves
  strong performance in challenging synthetic tasks such as logical inference (Bowman
  et al., 2015b) and ListOps (Nangia & Bowman, 2018). We also show that CRvNN performs
  comparably or better than prior latent structure models on real-world tasks such
  as sentiment analysis and natural language inference.
