title: 'Differentially Private Aggregation in the Shuffle Model: Almost Central Accuracy
  in Almost a Single Message'
abstract: The shuffle model of differential privacy has attracted attention in the
  literature due to it being a middle ground between the well-studied central and
  local models. In this work, we study the problem of summing (aggregating) real numbers
  or integers, a basic primitive in numerous machine learning tasks, in the shuffle
  model. We give a protocol achieving error arbitrarily close to that of the (Discrete)
  Laplace mechanism in central differential privacy, while each user only sends 1
  + o(1) short messages in expectation.
