title: Understanding Noise Injection in GANs
abstract: Noise injection is an effective way of circumventing overfitting and enhancing
  generalization in machine learning, the rationale of which has been validated in
  deep learning as well. Recently, noise injection exhibits surprising effectiveness
  when generating high-fidelity images in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) (e.g.
  StyleGAN). Despite its successful applications in GANs, the mechanism of its validity
  is still unclear. In this paper, we propose a geometric framework to theoretically
  analyze the role of noise injection in GANs. First, we point out the existence of
  the adversarial dimension trap inherent in GANs, which leads to the difficulty of
  learning a proper generator. Second, we successfully model the noise injection framework
  with exponential maps based on Riemannian geometry. Guided by our theories, we propose
  a general geometric realization for noise injection. Under our novel framework,
  the simple noise injection used in StyleGAN reduces to the Euclidean case. The goal
  of our work is to make theoretical steps towards understanding the underlying mechanism
  of state-of-the-art GAN algorithms. Experiments on image generation and GAN inversion
  validate our theory in practice.
