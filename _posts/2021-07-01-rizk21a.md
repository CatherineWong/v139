title: Best Arm Identification in Graphical Bilinear Bandits
abstract: We introduce a new graphical bilinear bandit problem where a learner (or
  a \emph{central entity}) allocates arms to the nodes of a graph and observes for
  each edge a noisy bilinear reward representing the interaction between the two end
  nodes. We study the best arm identification problem in which the learner wants to
  find the graph allocation maximizing the sum of the bilinear rewards. By efficiently
  exploiting the geometry of this bandit problem, we propose a \emph{decentralized}
  allocation strategy based on random sampling with theoretical guarantees. In particular,
  we characterize the influence of the graph structure (e.g. star, complete or circle)
  on the convergence rate and propose empirical experiments that confirm this dependency.
