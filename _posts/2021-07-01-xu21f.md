title: An End-to-End Framework for Molecular Conformation Generation via Bilevel Programming
abstract: Predicting molecular conformations (or 3D structures) from molecular graphs
  is a fundamental problem in many applications. Most existing approaches are usually
  divided into two steps by first predicting the distances between atoms and then
  generating a 3D structure through optimizing a distance geometry problem. However,
  the distances predicted with such two-stage approaches may not be able to consistently
  preserve the geometry of local atomic neighborhoods, making the generated structures
  unsatisfying. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end solution for molecular conformation
  prediction called ConfVAE based on the conditional variational autoencoder framework.
  Specifically, the molecular graph is first encoded in a latent space, and then the
  3D structures are generated by solving a principled bilevel optimization program.
  Extensive experiments on several benchmark data sets prove the effectiveness of
  our proposed approach over existing state-of-the-art approaches. Code is available
