title: Streaming Bayesian Deep Tensor Factorization
abstract: Despite the success of existing tensor factorization methods, most of them
  conduct a multilinear decomposition, and rarely exploit powerful modeling frameworks,
  like deep neural networks, to capture a variety of complicated interactions in data.
  More important, for highly expressive, deep factorization, we lack an effective
  approach to handle streaming data, which are ubiquitous in real-world applications.
  To address these issues, we propose SBTD, a Streaming Bayesian Deep Tensor factorization
  method. We first use Bayesian neural networks (NNs) to build a deep tensor factorization
  model. We assign a spike-and-slab prior over each NN weight to encourage sparsity
  and to prevent overfitting. We then use multivariate Deltaâ€™s method and moment matching
  to approximate the posterior of the NN output and calculate the running model evidence,
  based on which we develop an efficient streaming posterior inference algorithm in
  the assumed-density-filtering and expectation propagation framework. Our algorithm
  provides responsive incremental updates for the posterior of the latent factors
  and NN weights upon receiving newly observed tensor entries, and meanwhile identify
  and inhibit redundant/useless weights. We show the advantages of our approach in
  four real-world applications.
