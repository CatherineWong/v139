title: 'The Earth Mover’s Pinball Loss: Quantiles for Histogram-Valued Regression'
abstract: Although ubiquitous in the sciences, histogram data have not received much
  attention by the Deep Learning community. Whilst regression and classification tasks
  for scalar and vector data are routinely solved by neural networks, a principled
  approach for estimating histogram labels as a function of an input vector or image
  is lacking in the literature. We present a dedicated method for Deep Learning-based
  histogram regression, which incorporates cross-bin information and yields distributions
  over possible histograms, expressed by $\tau$-quantiles of the cumulative histogram
  in each bin. The crux of our approach is a new loss function obtained by applying
  the pinball loss to the cumulative histogram, which for 1D histograms reduces to
  the Earth Mover’s distance (EMD) in the special case of the median ($\tau = 0.5$),
  and generalizes it to arbitrary quantiles. We validate our method with an illustrative
  toy example, a football-related task, and an astrophysical computer vision problem.
  We show that with our loss function, the accuracy of the predicted median histograms
  is very similar to the standard EMD case (and higher than for per-bin loss functions
  such as cross-entropy), while the predictions become much more informative at almost
  no additional computational cost.
