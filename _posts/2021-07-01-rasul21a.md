title: Autoregressive Denoising Diffusion Models for Multivariate Probabilistic Time
  Series Forecasting
abstract: In this work, we propose TimeGrad, an autoregressive model for multivariate
  probabilistic time series forecasting which samples from the data distribution at
  each time step by estimating its gradient. To this end, we use diffusion probabilistic
  models, a class of latent variable models closely connected to score matching and
  energy-based methods. Our model learns gradients by optimizing a variational bound
  on the data likelihood and at inference time converts white noise into a sample
  of the distribution of interest through a Markov chain using Langevin sampling.
  We demonstrate experimentally that the proposed autoregressive denoising diffusion
  model is the new state-of-the-art multivariate probabilistic forecasting method
  on real-world data sets with thousands of correlated dimensions. We hope that this
  method is a useful tool for practitioners and lays the foundation for future research
  in this area.
