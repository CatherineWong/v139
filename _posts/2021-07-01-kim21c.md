title: Reward Identification in Inverse Reinforcement Learning
abstract: We study the problem of reward identifiability in the context of Inverse
  Reinforcement Learning (IRL). The reward identifiability question is critical to
  answer when reasoning about the effectiveness of using Markov Decision Processes
  (MDPs) as computational models of real world decision makers in order to understand
  complex decision making behavior and perform counterfactual reasoning. While identifiability
  has been acknowledged as a fundamental theoretical question in IRL, little is known
  about the types of MDPs for which rewards are identifiable, or even if there exist
  such MDPs. In this work, we formalize the reward identification problem in IRL and
  study how identifiability relates to properties of the MDP model. For deterministic
  MDP models with the MaxEntRL objective, we prove necessary and sufficient conditions
  for identifiability. Building on these results, we present efficient algorithms
  for testing whether or not an MDP model is identifiable.
