title: Generative Adversarial Transformers
abstract: We introduce the GANsformer, a novel and efficient type of transformer,
  and explore it for the task of visual generative modeling. The network employs a
  bipartite structure that enables long-range interactions across the image, while
  maintaining computation of linear efficiency, that can readily scale to high-resolution
  synthesis. It iteratively propagates information from a set of latent variables
  to the evolving visual features and vice versa, to support the refinement of each
  in light of the other and encourage the emergence of compositional representations
  of objects and scenes. In contrast to the classic transformer architecture, it utilizes
  multiplicative integration that allows flexible region-based modulation, and can
  thus be seen as a generalization of the successful StyleGAN network. We demonstrate
  the model’s strength and robustness through a careful evaluation over a range of
  datasets, from simulated multi-object environments to rich real-world indoor and
  outdoor scenes, showing it achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of image quality
  and diversity, while enjoying fast learning and better data-efficiency. Further
  qualitative and quantitative experiments offer us an insight into the model’s inner
  workings, revealing improved interpretability and stronger disentanglement, and
  illustrating the benefits and efficacy of our approach. An implementation of the
  model is available at https://github.com/dorarad/gansformer.
