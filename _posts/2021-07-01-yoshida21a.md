title: Lower-Bounded Proper Losses for Weakly Supervised Classification
abstract: This paper discusses the problem of weakly supervised classification, in
  which instances are given weak labels that are produced by some label-corruption
  process. The goal is to derive conditions under which loss functions for weak-label
  learning are proper and lower-boundedâ€”two essential requirements for the losses
  used in class-probability estimation. To this end, we derive a representation theorem
  for proper losses in supervised learning, which dualizes the Savage representation.
  We use this theorem to characterize proper weak-label losses and find a condition
  for them to be lower-bounded. From these theoretical findings, we derive a novel
  regularization scheme called generalized logit squeezing, which makes any proper
  weak-label loss bounded from below, without losing properness. Furthermore, we experimentally
  demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, as compared to improper
  or unbounded losses. The results highlight the importance of properness and lower-boundedness.
