title: Generalization Guarantees for Neural Architecture Search with Train-Validation
  Split
abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is a popular method for automatically designing
  optimized deep-learning architectures. NAS methods commonly use bilevel optimization
  where one optimizes the weights over the training data (lower-level problem) and
  hyperparameters - such as the architecture - over the validation data (upper-level
  problem). This paper explores the statistical aspects of such problems with train-validation
  splits. In practice, the lower-level problem is often overparameterized and can
  easily achieve zero loss. Thus, a-priori, it seems impossible to distinguish the
  right hyperparameters based on training loss alone which motivates a better understanding
  of train-validation split. To this aim, we first show that refined properties of
  the validation loss such as risk and hyper-gradients are indicative of those of
  the true test loss and help prevent overfitting with a near-minimal validation sample
  size. Importantly, this is established for continuous search spaces which are relevant
  for differentiable search schemes. We then establish generalization bounds for NAS
  problems with an emphasis on an activation search problem and gradient-based methods.
  Finally, we show rigorous connections between NAS and low-rank matrix learning which
  leads to algorithmic insights where the solution of the upper problem can be accurately
  learned via spectral methods to achieve near-minimal risk.
