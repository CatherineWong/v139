title: Backpropagated Neighborhood Aggregation for Accurate Training of Spiking Neural
  Networks
abstract: While Backpropagation (BP) has been applied to spiking neural networks (SNNs)
  achieving encouraging results, a key challenge involved is to backpropagate a differentiable
  continuous-valued loss over layers of spiking neurons exhibiting discontinuous all-or-none
  firing activities. Existing methods deal with this difficulty by introducing compromises
  that come with their own limitations, leading to potential performance degradation.
  We propose a novel BP-like method, called neighborhood aggregation (NA), which computes
  accurate error gradients guiding weight updates that may lead to discontinuous modifications
  of firing activities. NA achieves this goal by aggregating the error gradient over
  multiple spike trains in the neighborhood of the present spike train of each neuron.
  The employed aggregation is based on a generalized finite difference approximation
  with a proposed distance metric quantifying the similarity between a given pair
  of spike trains. Our experiments show that the proposed NA algorithm delivers state-of-the-art
  performance for SNN training on several datasets including CIFAR10.
