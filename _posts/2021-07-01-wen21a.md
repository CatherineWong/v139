title: Leveraged Weighted Loss for Partial Label Learning
abstract: As an important branch of weakly supervised learning, partial label learning
  deals with data where each instance is assigned with a set of candidate labels,
  whereas only one of them is true. Despite many methodology studies on learning from
  partial labels, there still lacks theoretical understandings of their risk consistent
  properties under relatively weak assumptions, especially on the link between theoretical
  results and the empirical choice of parameters. In this paper, we propose a family
  of loss functions named \textit{Leveraged Weighted} (LW) loss, which for the first
  time introduces the leverage parameter $\beta$ to consider the trade-off between
  losses on partial labels and non-partial ones. From the theoretical side, we derive
  a generalized result of risk consistency for the LW loss in learning from partial
  labels, based on which we provide guidance to the choice of the leverage parameter
  $\beta$. In experiments, we verify the theoretical guidance, and show the high effectiveness
  of our proposed LW loss on both benchmark and real datasets compared with other
  state-of-the-art partial label learning algorithms.
