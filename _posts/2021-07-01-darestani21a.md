title: Measuring Robustness in Deep Learning Based Compressive Sensing
abstract: 'Deep neural networks give state-of-the-art accuracy for reconstructing
  images from few and noisy measurements, a problem arising for example in accelerated
  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, recent works have raised concerns that
  deep-learning-based image reconstruction methods are sensitive to perturbations
  and are less robust than traditional methods: Neural networks (i) may be sensitive
  to small, yet adversarially-selected perturbations, (ii) may perform poorly under
  distribution shifts, and (iii) may fail to recover small but important features
  in an image. In order to understand the sensitivity to such perturbations, in this
  work, we measure the robustness of different approaches for image reconstruction
  including trained and un-trained neural networks as well as traditional sparsity-based
  methods. We find, contrary to prior works, that both trained and un-trained methods
  are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. Moreover, both trained and un-trained
  methods tuned for a particular dataset suffer very similarly from distribution shifts.
  Finally, we demonstrate that an image reconstruction method that achieves higher
  reconstruction quality, also performs better in terms of accurately recovering fine
  details. Our results indicate that the state-of-the-art deep-learning-based image
  reconstruction methods provide improved performance than traditional methods without
  compromising robustness.'
