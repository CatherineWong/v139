title: 'Operationalizing Complex Causes: A Pragmatic View of Mediation'
abstract: We examine the problem of causal response estimation for complex objects
  (e.g., text, images, genomics). In this setting, classical \emph{atomic} interventions
  are often not available (e.g., changes to characters, pixels, DNA base-pairs). Instead,
  we only have access to indirect or \emph{crude} interventions (e.g., enrolling in
  a writing program, modifying a scene, applying a gene therapy). In this work, we
  formalize this problem and provide an initial solution. Given a collection of candidate
  mediators, we propose (a) a two-step method for predicting the causal responses
  of crude interventions; and (b) a testing procedure to identify mediators of crude
  interventions. We demonstrate, on a range of simulated and real-world-inspired examples,
  that our approach allows us to efficiently estimate the effect of crude interventions
  with limited data from new treatment regimes.
