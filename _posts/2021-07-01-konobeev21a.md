title: A Distribution-dependent Analysis of Meta Learning
abstract: A key problem in the theory of meta-learning is to understand how the task
  distributions influence transfer risk, the expected error of a meta-learner on a
  new task drawn from the unknown task distribution. In this paper, focusing on fixed
  design linear regression with Gaussian noise and a Gaussian task (or parameter)
  distribution, we give distribution-dependent lower bounds on the transfer risk of
  any algorithm, while we also show that a novel, weighted version of the so-called
  biased regularized regression method is able to match these lower bounds up to a
  fixed constant factor. Notably, the weighting is derived from the covariance of
  the Gaussian task distribution. Altogether, our results provide a precise characterization
  of the difficulty of meta-learning in this Gaussian setting. While this problem
  setting may appear simple, we show that it is rich enough to unify the “parameter
  sharing” and “representation learning” streams of meta-learning; in particular,
  representation learning is obtained as the special case when the covariance matrix
  of the task distribution is unknown. For this case we propose to adopt the EM method,
  which is shown to enjoy efficient updates in our case. The paper is completed by
  an empirical study of EM. In particular, our experimental results show that the
  EM algorithm can attain the lower bound as the number of tasks grows, while the
  algorithm is also successful in competing with its alternatives when used in a representation
  learning context.
