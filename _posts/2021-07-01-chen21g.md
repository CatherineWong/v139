title: Decentralized Riemannian Gradient Descent on the Stiefel Manifold
abstract: We consider a distributed non-convex optimization where a network of agents
  aims at minimizing a global function over the Stiefel manifold. The global function
  is represented as a finite sum of smooth local functions, where each local function
  is associated with one agent and agents communicate with each other over an undirected
  connected graph. The problem is non-convex as local functions are possibly non-convex
  (but smooth) and the Steifel manifold is a non-convex set. We present a decentralized
  Riemannian stochastic gradient method (DRSGD) with the convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{K})$
  to a stationary point. To have exact convergence with constant stepsize, we also
  propose a decentralized Riemannian gradient tracking algorithm (DRGTA) with the
  convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/K)$ to a stationary point. We use multi-step
  consensus to preserve the iteration in the local (consensus) region. DRGTA is the
  first decentralized algorithm with exact convergence for distributed optimization
  on Stiefel manifold.
