title: Online Unrelated Machine Load Balancing with Predictions Revisited
abstract: We study the online load balancing problem with machine learned predictions,
  and give results that improve upon and extend those in a recent paper by Lattanzi
  et al. (2020). First, we design deterministic and randomized online rounding algorithms
  for the problem in the unrelated machine setting, with $O(\frac{\log m}{\log \log
  m})$- and $O(\frac{\log \log m}{\log \log \log m})$-competitive ratios. They respectively
  improve upon the previous ratios of $O(\log m)$ and $O(\log^3\log m)$, and match
  the lower bounds given by Lattanzi et al. Second, we extend their prediction scheme
  from the identical machine restricted assignment setting to the unrelated machine
  setting. With the knowledge of two vectors over machines, a dual vector and a weight
  vector, we can construct a good fractional assignment online, that can be passed
  to an online rounding algorithm. Finally, we consider the learning model introduced
  by Lavastida et al. (2020), and show that under the model, the two vectors can be
  learned efficiently with a few samples of instances.
