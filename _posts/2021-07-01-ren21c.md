title: Integrated Defense for Resilient Graph Matching
abstract: 'A recent study has shown that graph matching models are vulnerable to adversarial
  manipulation of their input which is intended to cause a mismatching. Nevertheless,
  there is still a lack of a comprehensive solution for further enhancing the robustness
  of graph matching against adversarial attacks. In this paper, we identify and study
  two types of unique topology attacks in graph matching: inter-graph dispersion and
  intra-graph assembly attacks. We propose an integrated defense model, IDRGM, for
  resilient graph matching with two novel defense techniques to defend against the
  above two attacks simultaneously. A detection technique of inscribed simplexes in
  the hyperspheres consisting of multiple matched nodes is proposed to tackle inter-graph
  dispersion attacks, in which the distances among the matched nodes in multiple graphs
  are maximized to form regular simplexes. A node separation method based on phase-type
  distribution and maximum likelihood estimation is developed to estimate the distribution
  of perturbed graphs and separate the nodes within the same graphs over a wide space,
  for defending intra-graph assembly attacks, such that the interference from the
  similar neighbors of the perturbed nodes is significantly reduced. We evaluate the
  robustness of our IDRGM model on real datasets against state-of-the-art algorithms.'
