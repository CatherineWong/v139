title: Keyframe-Focused Visual Imitation Learning
abstract: 'Imitation learning trains control policies by mimicking pre-recorded expert
  demonstrations. In partially observable settings, imitation policies must rely on
  observation histories, but many seemingly paradoxical results show better performance
  for policies that only access the most recent observation. Recent solutions ranging
  from causal graph learning to deep information bottlenecks have shown promising
  results, but failed to scale to realistic settings such as visual imitation. We
  propose a solution that outperforms these prior approaches by upweighting demonstration
  keyframes corresponding to expert action changepoints. This simple approach easily
  scales to complex visual imitation settings. Our experimental results demonstrate
  consistent performance improvements over all baselines on image-based Gym MuJoCo
  continuous control tasks. Finally, on the CARLA photorealistic vision-based urban
  driving simulator, we resolve a long-standing issue in behavioral cloning for driving
  by demonstrating effective imitation from observation histories. Supplementary materials
