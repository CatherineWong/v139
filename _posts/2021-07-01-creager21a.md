title: Environment Inference for Invariant Learning
abstract: Learning models that gracefully handle distribution shifts is central to
  research on domain generalization, robust optimization, and fairness. A promising
  formulation is domain-invariant learning, which identifies the key issue of learning
  which features are domain-specific versus domain-invariant. An important assumption
  in this area is that the training examples are partitioned into “domains” or “environments”.
  Our focus is on the more common setting where such partitions are not provided.
  We propose EIIL, a general framework for domain-invariant learning that incorporates
  Environment Inference to directly infer partitions that are maximally informative
  for downstream Invariant Learning. We show that EIIL outperforms invariant learning
  methods on the CMNIST benchmark without using environment labels, and significantly
  outperforms ERM on worst-group performance in the Waterbirds dataset. Finally, we
  establish connections between EIIL and algorithmic fairness, which enables EIIL
  to improve accuracy and calibration in a fair prediction problem.
