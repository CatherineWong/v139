title: A Sampling-Based Method for Tensor Ring Decomposition
abstract: We propose a sampling-based method for computing the tensor ring (TR) decomposition
  of a data tensor. The method uses leverage score sampled alternating least squares
  to fit the TR cores in an iterative fashion. By taking advantage of the special
  structure of TR tensors, we can efficiently estimate the leverage scores and attain
  a method which has complexity sublinear in the number of input tensor entries. We
  provide high-probability relative-error guarantees for the sampled least squares
  problems. We compare our proposal to existing methods in experiments on both synthetic
  and real data. Our method achieves substantial speedup—sometimes two or three orders
  of magnitude—over competing methods, while maintaining good accuracy. We also provide
  an example of how our method can be used for rapid feature extraction.
