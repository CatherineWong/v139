title: 'PixelTransformer: Sample Conditioned Signal Generation'
abstract: We propose a generative model that can infer a distribution for the underlying
  spatial signal conditioned on sparse samples e.g. plausible images given a few observed
  pixels. In contrast to sequential autoregressive generative models, our model allows
  conditioning on arbitrary samples and can answer distributional queries for any
  location. We empirically validate our approach across three image datasets and show
  that we learn to generate diverse and meaningful samples, with the distribution
  variance reducing given more observed pixels. We also show that our approach is
  applicable beyond images and can allow generating other types of spatial outputs
  e.g. polynomials, 3D shapes, and videos.
