title: Decomposable Submodular Function Minimization via Maximum Flow
abstract: This paper bridges discrete and continuous optimization approaches for decomposable
  submodular function minimization, in both the standard and parametric settings.
  We provide improved running times for this problem by reducing it to a number of
  calls to a maximum flow oracle. When each function in the decomposition acts on
  O(1) elements of the ground set V and is polynomially bounded, our running time
  is up to polylogarithmic factors equal to that of solving maximum flow in a sparse
  graph with O(|V|) vertices and polynomial integral capacities. We achieve this by
  providing a simple iterative method which can optimize to high precision any convex
  function defined on the submodular base polytope, provided we can efficiently minimize
  it on the base polytope corresponding to the cut function of a certain graph that
  we construct. We solve this minimization problem by lifting the solutions of a parametric
  cut problem, which we obtain via a new efficient combinatorial reduction to maximum
  flow. This reduction is of independent interest and implies some previously unknown
  bounds for the parametric minimum s,t-cut problem in multiple settings.
