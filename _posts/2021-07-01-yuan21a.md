title: Federated Deep AUC Maximization for Hetergeneous Data with a Constant Communication
  Complexity
abstract: Deep AUC (area under the ROC curve) Maximization (DAM) has attracted much
  attention recently due to its great potential for imbalanced data classification.
  However, the research on Federated Deep AUC Maximization (FDAM) is still limited.
  Compared with standard federated learning (FL) approaches that focus on decomposable
  minimization objectives, FDAM is more complicated due to its minimization objective
  is non-decomposable over individual examples. In this paper, we propose improved
  FDAM algorithms for heterogeneous data by solving the popular non-convex strongly-concave
  min-max formulation of DAM in a distributed fashion, which can also be applied to
  a class of non-convex strongly-concave min-max problems. A striking result of this
  paper is that the communication complexity of the proposed algorithm is a constant
  independent of the number of machines and also independent of the accuracy level,
  which improves an existing result by orders of magnitude. The experiments have demonstrated
  the effectiveness of our FDAM algorithm on benchmark datasets, and on medical chest
  X-ray images from different organizations. Our experiment shows that the performance
  of FDAM using data from multiple hospitals can improve the AUC score on testing
  data from a single hospital for detecting life-threatening diseases based on chest
  radiographs.
