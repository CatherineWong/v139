title: Characterizing the Gap Between Actor-Critic and Policy Gradient
abstract: Actor-critic (AC) methods are ubiquitous in reinforcement learning. Although
  it is understood that AC methods are closely related to policy gradient (PG), their
  precise connection has not been fully characterized previously. In this paper, we
  explain the gap between AC and PG methods by identifying the exact adjustment to
  the AC objective/gradient that recovers the true policy gradient of the cumulative
  reward objective (PG). Furthermore, by viewing the AC method as a two-player Stackelberg
  game between the actor and critic, we show that the Stackelberg policy gradient
  can be recovered as a special case of our more general analysis. Based on these
  results, we develop practical algorithms, Residual Actor-Critic and Stackelberg
  Actor-Critic, for estimating the correction between AC and PG and use these to modify
  the standard AC algorithm. Experiments on popular tabular and continuous environments
  show the proposed corrections can improve both the sample efficiency and final performance
  of existing AC methods.
