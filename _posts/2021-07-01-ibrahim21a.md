title: Crowdsourcing via Annotator Co-occurrence Imputation and Provable Symmetric
  Nonnegative Matrix Factorization
abstract: 'Unsupervised learning of the Dawid-Skene (D&S) model from noisy, incomplete
  and crowdsourced annotations has been a long-standing challenge, and is a critical
  step towards reliably labeling massive data. A recent work takes a coupled nonnegative
  matrix factorization (CNMF) perspective, and shows appealing features: It ensures
  the identifiability of the D&S model and enjoys low sample complexity, as only the
  estimates of the co-occurrences of annotator labels are involved. However, the identifiability
  holds only when certain somewhat restrictive conditions are met in the context of
  crowdsourcing. Optimizing the CNMF criterion is also costly—and convergence assurances
  are elusive. This work recasts the pairwise co-occurrence based D&S model learning
  problem as a symmetric NMF (SymNMF) problem—which offers enhanced identifiability
  relative to CNMF. In practice, the SymNMF model is often (largely) incomplete, due
  to the lack of co-labeled items by some annotators. Two lightweight algorithms are
  proposed for co-occurrence imputation. Then, a low-complexity shifted rectified
  linear unit (ReLU)-empowered SymNMF algorithm is proposed to identify the D&S model.
  Various performance characterizations (e.g., missing co-occurrence recoverability,
  stability, and convergence) and evaluations are also presented.'
