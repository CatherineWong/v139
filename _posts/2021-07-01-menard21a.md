title: Fast active learning for pure exploration in reinforcement learning
abstract: Realistic environments often provide agents with very limited feedback.
  When the environment is initially unknown, the feedback, in the beginning, can be
  completely absent, and the agents may first choose to devote all their effort on
  \emph{exploring efficiently.} The exploration remains a challenge while it has been
  addressed with many hand-tuned heuristics with different levels of generality on
  one side, and a few theoretically-backed exploration strategies on the other. Many
  of them are incarnated by \emph{intrinsic motivation} and in particular \emph{explorations
  bonuses}. A common choice is to use $1/\sqrt{n}$ bonus, where $n$ is a number of
  times this particular state-action pair was visited. We show that, surprisingly,
  for a pure-exploration objective of \emph{reward-free exploration}, bonuses that
  scale with $1/n$ bring faster learning rates, improving the known upper bounds with
  respect to the dependence on the horizon $H$. Furthermore, we show that with an
  improved analysis of the stopping time, we can improve by a factor $H$ the sample
  complexity in the \emph{best-policy identification} setting, which is another pure-exploration
  objective, where the environment provides rewards but the agent is not penalized
  for its behavior during the exploration phase.
