title: Grid-Functioned Neural Networks
abstract: We introduce a new neural network architecture that we call "grid-functioned"
  neural networks. It utilises a grid structure of network parameterisations that
  can be specialised for different subdomains of the problem, while maintaining smooth,
  continuous behaviour. The grid gives the user flexibility to prevent gross features
  from overshadowing important minor ones. We present a full characterisation of its
  computational and spatial complexity, and demonstrate its potential, compared to
  a traditional architecture, over a set of synthetic regression problems. We further
  illustrate the benefits through a real-world 3D skeletal animation case study, where
  it offers the same visual quality as a state-of-the-art model, but with lower computational
  complexity and better control accuracy.
