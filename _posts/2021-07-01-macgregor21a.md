title: Local Algorithms for Finding Densely Connected Clusters
abstract: Local graph clustering is an important algorithmic technique for analysing
  massive graphs, and has been widely applied in many research fields of data science.
  While the objective of most (local) graph clustering algorithms is to find a vertex
  set of low conductance, there has been a sequence of recent studies that highlight
  the importance of the inter-connection between clusters when analysing real-world
  datasets. Following this line of research, in this work we study local algorithms
  for finding a pair of vertex sets defined with respect to their inter-connection
  and their relationship with the rest of the graph. The key to our analysis is a
  new reduction technique that relates the structure of multiple sets to a single
  vertex set in the reduced graph. Among many potential applications, we show that
  our algorithms successfully recover densely connected clusters in the Interstate
  Disputes Dataset and the US Migration Dataset.
