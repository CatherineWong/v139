title: 'DORO: Distributional and Outlier Robust Optimization'
abstract: 'Many machine learning tasks involve subpopulation shift where the testing
  data distribution is a subpopulation of the training distribution. For such settings,
  a line of recent work has proposed the use of a variant of empirical risk minimization(ERM)
  known as distributionally robust optimization (DRO). In this work, we apply DRO
  to real, large-scale tasks with subpopulation shift, and observe that DRO performs
  relatively poorly, and moreover has severe instability. We identify one direct cause
  of this phenomenon: sensitivity of DRO to outliers in the datasets. To resolve this
  issue, we propose the framework of DORO, for Distributional and Outlier Robust Optimization.
  At the core of this approach is a refined risk function which prevents DRO from
  overfitting to potential outliers. We instantiate DORO for the Cressie-Read family
  of RÃ©nyi divergence, and delve into two specific instances of this family: CVaR
  and $\chi^2$-DRO. We theoretically prove the effectiveness of the proposed method,
  and empirically show that DORO improves the performance and stability of DRO with
  experiments on large modern datasets, thereby positively addressing the open question
  raised by Hashimoto et al., 2018. Codes are available at https://github.com/RuntianZ/doro.'
