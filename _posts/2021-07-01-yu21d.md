title: Deep Latent Graph Matching
abstract: Deep learning for graph matching (GM) has emerged as an important research
  topic due to its superior performance over traditional methods and insights it provides
  for solving other combinatorial problems on graph. While recent deep methods for
  GM extensively investigated effective node/edge feature learning or downstream GM
  solvers given such learned features, there is little existing work questioning if
  the fixed connectivity/topology typically constructed using heuristics (e.g., Delaunay
  or k-nearest) is indeed suitable for GM. From a learning perspective, we argue that
  the fixed topology may restrict the model capacity and thus potentially hinder the
  performance. To address this, we propose to learn the (distribution of) latent topology,
  which can better support the downstream GM task. We devise two latent graph generation
  procedures, one deterministic and one generative. Particularly, the generative procedure
  emphasizes the across-graph consistency and thus can be viewed as a matching-guided
  co-generative model. Our methods deliver superior performance over previous state-of-the-arts
  on public benchmarks, hence supporting our hypothesis.
