title: Making Paper Reviewing Robust to Bid Manipulation Attacks
abstract: Most computer science conferences rely on paper bidding to assign reviewers
  to papers. Although paper bidding enables high-quality assignments in days of unprecedented
  submission numbers, it also opens the door for dishonest reviewers to adversarially
  influence paper reviewing assignments. Anecdotal evidence suggests that some reviewers
  bid on papers by "friends" or colluding authors, even though these papers are outside
  their area of expertise, and recommend them for acceptance without considering the
  merit of the work. In this paper, we study the efficacy of such bid manipulation
  attacks and find that, indeed, they can jeopardize the integrity of the review process.
  We develop a novel approach for paper bidding and assignment that is much more robust
  against such attacks. We show empirically that our approach provides robustness
  even when dishonest reviewers collude, have full knowledge of the assignment system’s
  internal workings, and have access to the system’s inputs. In addition to being
  more robust, the quality of our paper review assignments is comparable to that of
  current, non-robust assignment approaches.
