title: PAC-Learning for Strategic Classification
abstract: 'The study of strategic or adversarial manipulation of testing data to fool
  a classifier has attracted much recent attention. Most previous works have focused
  on two extreme situations where any testing data point either is completely adversarial
  or always equally prefers the positive label. In this paper, we generalize both
  of these through a unified framework for strategic classification and introduce
  the notion of strategic VC-dimension (SVC) to capture the PAC-learnability in our
  general strategic setup. SVC provably generalizes the recent concept of adversarial
  VC-dimension (AVC) introduced by Cullina et al. (2018). We instantiate our framework
  for the fundamental strategic linear classification problem. We fully characterize:
  (1) the statistical learnability of linear classifiers by pinning down its SVC;
  (2) itâ€™s computational tractability by pinning down the complexity of the empirical
  risk minimization problem. Interestingly, the SVC of linear classifiers is always
  upper bounded by its standard VC-dimension. This characterization also strictly
  generalizes the AVC bound for linear classifiers in (Cullina et al., 2018).'
