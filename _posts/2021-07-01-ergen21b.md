title: Revealing the Structure of Deep Neural Networks via Convex Duality
abstract: We study regularized deep neural networks (DNNs) and introduce a convex
  analytic framework to characterize the structure of the hidden layers. We show that
  a set of optimal hidden layer weights for a norm regularized DNN training problem
  can be explicitly found as the extreme points of a convex set. For the special case
  of deep linear networks, we prove that each optimal weight matrix aligns with the
  previous layers via duality. More importantly, we apply the same characterization
  to deep ReLU networks with whitened data and prove the same weight alignment holds.
  As a corollary, we also prove that norm regularized deep ReLU networks yield spline
  interpolation for one-dimensional datasets which was previously known only for two-layer
  networks. Furthermore, we provide closed-form solutions for the optimal layer weights
  when data is rank-one or whitened. The same analysis also applies to architectures
  with batch normalization even for arbitrary data. Therefore, we obtain a complete
  explanation for a recent empirical observation termed Neural Collapse where class
  means collapse to the vertices of a simplex equiangular tight frame.
