title: A Probabilistic Approach to Neural Network Pruning
abstract: Neural network pruning techniques reduce the number of parameters without
  compromising predicting ability of a network. Many algorithms have been developed
  for pruning both over-parameterized fully-connected networks (FCN) and convolutional
  neural networks (CNN), but analytical studies of capabilities and compression ratios
  of such pruned sub-networks are lacking. We theoretically study the performance
  of two pruning techniques (random and magnitude-based) on FCN and CNN. Given a target
  network, we provide a universal approach to bound the gap between a pruned and the
  target network in a probabilistic sense, which is the first study of this nature.
  The results establish that there exist pruned networks with expressive power within
  any specified bound from the target network and with a significant compression ratio.
