title: Classification with Rejection Based on Cost-sensitive Classification
abstract: 'The goal of classification with rejection is to avoid risky misclassification
  in error-critical applications such as medical diagnosis and product inspection.
  In this paper, based on the relationship between classification with rejection and
  cost-sensitive classification, we propose a novel method of classification with
  rejection by learning an ensemble of cost-sensitive classifiers, which satisfies
  all the following properties: (i) it can avoid estimating class-posterior probabilities,
  resulting in improved classification accuracy. (ii) it allows a flexible choice
  of losses including non-convex ones, (iii) it does not require complicated modifications
  when using different losses, (iv) it is applicable to both binary and multiclass
  cases, and (v) it is theoretically justifiable for any classification-calibrated
  loss. Experimental results demonstrate the usefulness of our proposed approach in
  clean-labeled, noisy-labeled, and positive-unlabeled classification.'
