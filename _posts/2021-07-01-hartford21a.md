title: Valid Causal Inference with (Some) Invalid Instruments
abstract: Instrumental variable methods provide a powerful approach to estimating
  causal effects in the presence of unobserved confounding. But a key challenge when
  applying them is the reliance on untestable "exclusion" assumptions that rule out
  any relationship between the instrument variable and the response that is not mediated
  by the treatment. In this paper, we show how to perform consistent IV estimation
  despite violations of the exclusion assumption. In particular, we show that when
  one has multiple candidate instruments, only a majority of these candidates—or,
  more generally, the modal candidate-response relationship—needs to be valid to estimate
  the causal effect. Our approach uses an estimate of the modal prediction from an
  ensemble of instrumental variable estimators. The technique is simple to apply and
  is "black-box" in the sense that it may be used with any instrumental variable estimator
  as long as the treatment effect is identified for each valid instrument independently.
  As such, it is compatible with recent machine-learning based estimators that allow
  for the estimation of conditional average treatment effects (CATE) on complex, high
  dimensional data. Experimentally, we achieve accurate estimates of conditional average
  treatment effects using an ensemble of deep network-based estimators, including
  on a challenging simulated Mendelian Randomization problem.
