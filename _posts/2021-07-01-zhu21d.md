title: Few-shot Language Coordination by Modeling Theory of Mind
abstract: 'No man is an island. Humans develop the ability to communicate with a large
  community by coordinating with different interlocutors within short conversations.
  This ability is largely understudied by the research on building neural language
  communicative agents. We study the task of few-shot language coordination: agents
  quickly adapting to their conversational partners’ language abilities. Different
  from current communicative agents trained with self-play, we in- investigate this
  more general paradigm by requiring the lead agent to coordinate with a population
  of agents each of whom has different linguistic abilities. This leads to a general
  agent able to quickly adapt to communicating with unseen agents in the population.
  Unlike prior work, success here requires the ability to model the partner’s beliefs,
  a vital component of human communication. Drawing inspiration from the study of
  theory-of-mind (ToM; Premack & Woodruff (1978)), we study the effect of the speaker
  explicitly modeling the listener’s mental state. Learning by communicating with
  a population, the speakers, as shown in our experiments, acquire the ability to
  learn to predict the reactions of their partner upon various messages on-the-fly.
  The speaker’s predictions for the future actions help it generate the best instructions
  in order to maximize communicative goal with message costs. To examine our hypothesis
  that the instructions generated with ToM modeling yield better communication per-
  performance, we employ our agents in both a referential game and a language navigation
  task. Positive results from our experiments also hint at the importance of explicitly
  modeling language acquisition as a socio-pragmatic progress.'
