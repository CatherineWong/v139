title: 'Beyond the Pareto Efficient Frontier: Constraint Active Search for Multiobjective
  Experimental Design'
abstract: 'Many problems in engineering design and simulation require balancing competing
  objectives under the presence of uncertainty. Sample-efficient multiobjective optimization
  methods focus on the objective function values in metric space and ignore the sampling
  behavior of the design configurations in parameter space. Consequently, they may
  provide little actionable insight on how to choose designs in the presence of metric
  uncertainty or limited precision when implementing a chosen design. We propose a
  new formulation that accounts for the importance of the parameter space and is thus
  more suitable for multiobjective design problems; instead of searching for the Pareto-efficient
  frontier, we solicit the desired minimum performance thresholds on all objectives
  to define regions of satisfaction. We introduce an active search algorithm called
  Expected Coverage Improvement (ECI) to efficiently discover the region of satisfaction
  and simultaneously sample diverse acceptable configurations. We demonstrate our
  algorithm on several design and simulation domains: mechanical design, additive
  manufacturing, medical monitoring, and plasma physics.'
