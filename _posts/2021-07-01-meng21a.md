title: An Integer Linear Programming Framework for Mining Constraints from Data
abstract: Structured output prediction problems (e.g., sequential tagging, hierarchical
  multi-class classification) often involve constraints over the output space. These
  constraints interact with the learned models to filter infeasible solutions and
  facilitate in building an accountable system. However, despite constraints are useful,
  they are often based on hand-crafted rules. This raises a question â€“ can we mine
  constraints and rules from data based on a learning algorithm? In this paper, we
  present a general framework for mining constraints from data. In particular, we
  consider the inference in structured output prediction as an integer linear programming
  (ILP) problem. Then, given the coefficients of the objective function and the corresponding
  solution, we mine the underlying constraints by estimating the outer and inner polytopes
  of the feasible set. We verify the proposed constraint mining algorithm in various
  synthetic and real-world applications and demonstrate that the proposed approach
  successfully identifies the feasible set at scale. In particular, we show that our
  approach can learn to solve 9x9 Sudoku puzzles and minimal spanning tree problems
  from examples without providing the underlying rules. Our algorithm can also integrate
  with a neural network model to learn the hierarchical label structure of a multi-label
  classification task. Besides, we provide theoretical analysis about the tightness
  of the polytopes and the reliability of the mined constraints.
