title: Maximum Mean Discrepancy Test is Aware of Adversarial Attacks
abstract: 'The maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) test could in principle detect any distributional
  discrepancy between two datasets. However, it has been shown that the MMD test is
  unaware of adversarial attacks–the MMD test failed to detect the discrepancy between
  natural data and adversarial data. Given this phenomenon, we raise a question: are
  natural and adversarial data really from different distributions? The answer is
  affirmative–the previous use of the MMD test on the purpose missed three key factors,
  and accordingly, we propose three components. Firstly, the Gaussian kernel has limited
  representation power, and we replace it with an effective deep kernel. Secondly,
  the test power of the MMD test was neglected, and we maximize it following asymptotic
  statistics. Finally, adversarial data may be non-independent, and we overcome this
  issue with the help of wild bootstrap. By taking care of the three factors, we verify
  that the MMD test is aware of adversarial attacks, which lights up a novel road
  for adversarial data detection based on two-sample tests.'
