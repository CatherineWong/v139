title: Learning Fair Policies in Decentralized Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement
  Learning
abstract: 'We consider the problem of learning fair policies in (deep) cooperative
  multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). We formalize it in a principled way as
  the problem of optimizing a welfare function that explicitly encodes two important
  aspects of fairness: efficiency and equity. We provide a theoretical analysis of
  the convergence of policy gradient for this problem. As a solution method, we propose
  a novel neural network architecture, which is composed of two sub-networks specifically
  designed for taking into account these two aspects of fairness. In experiments,
  we demonstrate the importance of the two sub-networks for fair optimization. Our
  overall approach is general as it can accommodate any (sub)differentiable welfare
  function. Therefore, it is compatible with various notions of fairness that have
  been proposed in the literature (e.g., lexicographic maximin, generalized Gini social
  welfare function, proportional fairness). Our method is generic and can be implemented
  in various MARL settings: centralized training and decentralized execution, or fully
  decentralized. Finally, we experimentally validate our approach in various domains
  and show that it can perform much better than previous methods, both in terms of
  efficiency and equity.'
