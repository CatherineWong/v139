title: Unsupervised Co-part Segmentation through Assembly
abstract: Co-part segmentation is an important problem in computer vision for its
  rich applications. We propose an unsupervised learning approach for co-part segmentation
  from images. For the training stage, we leverage motion information embedded in
  videos and explicitly extract latent representations to segment meaningful object
  parts. More importantly, we introduce a dual procedure of part-assembly to form
  a closed loop with part-segmentation, enabling an effective self-supervision. We
  demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with a host of extensive experiments,
  ranging from human bodies, hands, quadruped, and robot arms. We show that our approach
  can achieve meaningful and compact part segmentation, outperforming state-of-the-art
  approaches on diverse benchmarks.
