title: Regret Minimization in Stochastic Non-Convex Learning via a Proximal-Gradient
  Approach
abstract: This paper develops a methodology for regret minimization with stochastic
  first-order oracle feedback in online, constrained, non-smooth, non-convex problems.
  In this setting, the minimization of external regret is beyond reach for first-order
  methods, and there are no gradient-based algorithmic frameworks capable of providing
  a solution. On that account, we propose a conceptual approach that leverages non-convex
  optimality measures, leading to a suitable generalization of the learnerâ€™s local
  regret. We focus on a local regret measure defined via a proximal-gradient mapping,
  that also encompasses the original notion proposed by Hazan et al. (2017). To achieve
  no local regret in this setting, we develop a proximal-gradient method based on
  stochastic first-order feedback, and a simpler method for when access to a perfect
  first-order oracle is possible. Both methods are order-optimal (in the min-max sense),
  and we also establish a bound on the number of proximal-gradient queries these methods
  require. As an important application of our results, we also obtain a link between
  online and offline non-convex stochastic optimization manifested as a new proximal-gradient
  scheme with complexity guarantees matching those obtained via variance reduction
  techniques.
