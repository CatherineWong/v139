title: 'From Local to Global Norm Emergence: Dissolving Self-reinforcing Substructures
  with Incremental Social Instruments'
abstract: Norm emergence is a process where agents in a multi-agent system establish
  self-enforcing conformity through repeated interactions. When such interactions
  are confined to a social topology, several self-reinforcing substructures (SRS)
  may emerge within the population. This prevents a formation of a global norm. We
  propose incremental social instruments (ISI) to dissolve these SRSs by creating
  ties between agents. Establishing ties requires some effort and cost. Hence, it
  is worth to design methods that build a small number of ties yet dissolve the SRSs.
  By using the notion of information entropy, we propose an indicator called the BA-ratio
  that measures the current SRSs. We find that by building ties with minimal BA-ratio,
  our ISI is effective in facilitating the global norm emergence. We explain this
  through our experiments and theoretical results. Furthermore, we propose the small-degree
  principle in minimising the BA-ratio that helps us to design efficient ISI algorithms
  for finding the optimal ties. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world network
  topologies demonstrate that our adaptive ISI is efficient at dissolving SRS.
