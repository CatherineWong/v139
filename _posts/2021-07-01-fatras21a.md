title: Unbalanced minibatch Optimal Transport; applications to Domain Adaptation
abstract: Optimal transport distances have found many applications in machine learning
  for their capacity to compare non-parametric probability distributions. Yet their
  algorithmic complexity generally prevents their direct use on large scale datasets.
  Among the possible strategies to alleviate this issue, practitioners can rely on
  computing estimates of these distances over subsets of data, i.e. minibatches. While
  computationally appealing, we highlight in this paper some limits of this strategy,
  arguing it can lead to undesirable smoothing effects. As an alternative, we suggest
  that the same minibatch strategy coupled with unbalanced optimal transport can yield
  more robust behaviors. We discuss the associated theoretical properties, such as
  unbiased estimators, existence of gradients and concentration bounds. Our experimental
  study shows that in challenging problems associated to domain adaptation, the use
  of unbalanced optimal transport leads to significantly better results, competing
  with or surpassing recent baselines.
