title: 'Probabilistic Sequential Shrinking: A Best Arm Identification Algorithm for
  Stochastic Bandits with Corruptions'
abstract: We consider a best arm identification (BAI) problem for stochastic bandits
  with adversarial corruptions in the fixed-budget setting of T steps. We design a
  novel randomized algorithm, Probabilistic Sequential Shrinking(u) (PSS(u)), which
  is agnostic to the amount of corruptions. When the amount of corruptions per step
  (CPS) is below a threshold, PSS(u) identifies the best arm or item with probability
  tending to 1 as T{\rightarrow}$\infty$. Otherwise, the optimality gap of the identified
  item degrades gracefully with the CPS.We argue that such a bifurcation is necessary.
  In PSS(u), the parameter u serves to balance between the optimality gap and success
  probability. The injection of randomization is shown to be essential to mitigate
  the impact of corruptions. To demonstrate this, we design two attack strategies
  that are applicable to any algorithm. We apply one of them to a deterministic analogue
  of PSS(u) known as Successive Halving (SH) by Karnin et al. (2013). The attack strategy
  results in a high failure probability for SH, but PSS(u) remains robust. In the
  absence of corruptions, PSS(2)’s performance guarantee matches SH’s. We show that
  when the CPS is sufficiently large, no algorithm can achieve a BAI probability tending
  to 1 as T{\rightarrow}$\infty$. Numerical experiments corroborate our theoretical
  findings.
