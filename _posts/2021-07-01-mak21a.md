title: Nonparametric Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
abstract: Probabilistic programming uses programs to express generative models whose
  posterior probability is then computed by built-in inference engines. A challenging
  goal is to develop general purpose inference algorithms that work out-of-the-box
  for arbitrary programs in a universal probabilistic programming language (PPL).
  The densities defined by such programs, which may use stochastic branching and recursion,
  are (in general) nonparametric, in the sense that they correspond to models on an
  infinite-dimensional parameter space. However standard inference algorithms, such
  as the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm, target distributions with a fixed
  number of parameters. This paper introduces the Nonparametric Hamiltonian Monte
  Carlo (NP-HMC) algorithm which generalises HMC to nonparametric models. Inputs to
  NP-HMC are a new class of measurable functions called “tree representable”, which
  serve as a language-independent representation of the density functions of probabilistic
  programs in a universal PPL. We provide a correctness proof of NP-HMC, and empirically
  demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing approaches on several
  nonparametric examples.
