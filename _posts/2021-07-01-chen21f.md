title: Neural Feature Matching in Implicit 3D Representations
abstract: Recently, neural implicit functions have achieved impressive results for
  encoding 3D shapes. Conditioning on low-dimensional latent codes generalises a single
  implicit function to learn shared representation space for a variety of shapes,
  with the advantage of smooth interpolation. While the benefits from the global latent
  space do not correspond to explicit points at local level, we propose to track the
  continuous point trajectory by matching implicit features with the latent code interpolating
  between shapes, from which we corroborate the hierarchical functionality of the
  deep implicit functions, where early layers map the latent code to fitting the coarse
  shape structure, and deeper layers further refine the shape details. Furthermore,
  the structured representation space of implicit functions enables to apply feature
  matching for shape deformation, with the benefits to handle topology and semantics
  inconsistency, such as from an armchair to a chair with no arms, without explicit
  flow functions or manual annotations.
