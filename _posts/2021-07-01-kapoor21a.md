title: 'SKIing on Simplices: Kernel Interpolation on the Permutohedral Lattice for
  Scalable Gaussian Processes'
abstract: State-of-the-art methods for scalable Gaussian processes use iterative algorithms,
  requiring fast matrix vector multiplies (MVMs) with the co-variance kernel. The
  Structured Kernel Interpolation (SKI) framework accelerates these MVMs by performing
  efficient MVMs on a grid and interpolating back to the original space. In this work,
  we develop a connection between SKI and the permutohedral lattice used for high-dimensional
  fast bilateral filtering. Using a sparse simplicial grid instead of a dense rectangular
  one, we can perform GP inference exponentially faster in the dimension than SKI.
  Our approach, Simplex-GP, enables scaling SKI to high dimensions, while maintaining
  strong predictive performance. We additionally provide a CUDA implementation of
  Simplex-GP, which enables significant GPU acceleration of MVM based inference.
