title: 'On the Implicit Bias of Initialization Shape: Beyond Infinitesimal Mirror
  Descent'
abstract: Recent work has highlighted the role of initialization scale in determining
  the structure of the solutions that gradient methods converge to. In particular,
  it was shown that large initialization leads to the neural tangent kernel regime
  solution, whereas small initialization leads to so called “rich regimes”. However,
  the initialization structure is richer than the overall scale alone and involves
  relative magnitudes of different weights and layers in the network. Here we show
  that these relative scales, which we refer to as initialization shape, play an important
  role in determining the learned model. We develop a novel technique for deriving
  the inductive bias of gradient-flow and use it to obtain closed-form implicit regularizers
  for multiple cases of interest.
