title: Few-Shot Conformal Prediction with Auxiliary Tasks
abstract: We develop a novel approach to conformal prediction when the target task
  has limited data available for training. Conformal prediction identifies a small
  set of promising output candidates in place of a single prediction, with guarantees
  that the set contains the correct answer with high probability. When training data
  is limited, however, the predicted set can easily become unusably large. In this
  work, we obtain substantially tighter prediction sets while maintaining desirable
  marginal guarantees by casting conformal prediction as a meta-learning paradigm
  over exchangeable collections of auxiliary tasks. Our conformalization algorithm
  is simple, fast, and agnostic to the choice of underlying model, learning algorithm,
  or dataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach across a number of
  few-shot classification and regression tasks in natural language processing, computer
  vision, and computational chemistry for drug discovery.
