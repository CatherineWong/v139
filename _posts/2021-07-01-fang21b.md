title: On Variational Inference in Biclustering Models
abstract: Biclustering structures exist ubiquitously in data matrices and the biclustering
  problem was first formalized by John Hartigan (1972) to cluster rows and columns
  simultaneously. In this paper, we develop a theory for the estimation of general
  biclustering models, where the data is assumed to follow certain statistical distribution
  with underlying biclustering structure. Due to the existence of latent variables,
  directly computing the maximal likelihood estimator is prohibitively difficult in
  practice and we instead consider the variational inference (VI) approach to solve
  the parameter estimation problem. Although variational inference method generally
  has good empirical performance, there are very few theoretical results around VI.
  In this paper, we obtain the precise estimation bound of variational estimator and
  show that it matches the minimax rate in terms of estimation error under mild assumptions
  in biclustering setting. Furthermore, we study the convergence property of the coordinate
  ascent variational inference algorithm, where both local and global convergence
  results have been provided. Numerical results validate our new theories.
