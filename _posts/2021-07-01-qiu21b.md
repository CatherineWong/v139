title: Provably Efficient Fictitious Play Policy Optimization for Zero-Sum Markov
  Games with Structured Transitions
abstract: 'While single-agent policy optimization in a fixed environment has attracted
  a lot of research attention recently in the reinforcement learning community, much
  less is known theoretically when there are multiple agents playing in a potentially
  competitive environment. We take steps forward by proposing and analyzing new fictitious
  play policy optimization algorithms for two-player zero-sum Markov games with structured
  but unknown transitions. We consider two classes of transition structures: factored
  independent transition and single-controller transition. For both scenarios, we
  prove tight $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ regret bounds after $T$ steps in
  a two-agent competitive game scenario. The regret of each player is measured against
  a potentially adversarial opponent who can choose a single best policy in hindsight
  after observing the full policy sequence. Our algorithms feature a combination of
  Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)-type optimism and fictitious play under the scope of
  simultaneous policy optimization in a non-stationary environment. When both players
  adopt the proposed algorithms, their overall optimality gap is $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$.'
